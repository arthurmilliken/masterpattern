This may sound almost too easy, but we must remember that the great Masters all declare, with Jesus: "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light." This should be borne in mind, also, as we consider the final Key of this series. The fearsome aspect of the Devil is nothing but delusion. There is no reality in the universe corresponding to this dreadful figure. For the perfect knowledge of the Life-power there are no problems whatever, nor any ignorance at all. The true Self of you, at this very moment, knows just what you must do to be free from whatever form of bondage seems now to limit you. Mentally relate yourself to that liberating power, and you will find the solution of the problem (Key 15).

No slightest detail of our daily lives can possibly be excluded from the sequence of Divine Manifestation. Whatever seems to be otherwise is merely evidence of temporary delusion, and even that delusion has its place in the Great Plan (Key 10).

Venus, again, as ruler of the formative and image-making power of subconsciousness, is dominant in second Key of this row. But here her power is linked with that of the Moon, represented in Tarot by the High Priestess. If we seek to square our lives with the true order of the universe, we must invoke the power of intuition. We must learn from our observation of what is below in the field of sensation, but we cannot know the meaning of what we observe unless it be imparted to us from what Tarot pictures as the Hierophant (Key 5).

"I utter myself by seeing," says The Book of Tokens, and in practical occultism we must remember always that the Heavenly Vision is the real cause of the Earthly Appearance. This physical universe is the embodiment of the mental seeing which is an essential quality of the Fiery Intelligence, pictured by the Tarot Fool. Not yet do we share that vision, for it is beheld at a level which to us is superconscious. Yet we are assured by the wise that the Spirit of Life in us is now and always the Seer of that glorious Beyond which looms up to inconceivable heights, transcending the utmost yet attained by humanity. (Key 0).
