Thus when Patanjali says meditation is an unbroken flow of knowledge in a particular object, reflection makes it evident that true meditation is participation in the One Spirit's unbroken flow of knowledge in all things. Really to meditate, then, is to be identified, during meditation, with the Divine Consciousness of some aspect of reality. This, indeed, is why all genuine occult literature lays so much stress on the importance of meditation (Key 17).

In meditation, the personal mentation, always intermittent and spasmodic, is wholly suspended. Thus a sage in *Samadhi* is in a state of trance; and in the deepest stages the trance is so complete that it counterfeits death (Key 12).

Yet this suspension of personal activity is accompanied by a tremendous enhancement of real consciousness. The personal vehicle is at rest. The senses are completely quiescent. Yet the Self is wide awake, and there is no cessation of Self-consciousness. He who emerges from the trance of true meditation does not ask ”Where am I?” Neither does he make any inquiries as to what he has said or done, for he has never lest consciousness for a moment.

What has happened has been that his consciousness has been functioning at a higher level. From that level he invariably brings back with him definite knowledge, and equally definite ability to exercise power beyond the limits of ordinary personal consciousness (Key 7).

"For such an one has, in Samadhi, remembered what he really is, and the glory and power of that recollection manifest themselves" (Key 2)

MEDITATION: Keys 17, 12, 7, 2. Truth itself is the basis of my personal existence. Nothing can separate me from its unfailing support. No slightest detail of my personal life but is a manifestation of Universal Spirit. I REMEMBER MY CREATOR.
