All Nature and all her forces are my allies. The motive power of the cosmic mechanism is seated in my heart. I am the incarnate Law. THE WORD OF POWER UTTERS ITSELF WITHIN THE SANCTUARY OF MY INNER LIFE.

In every ritual of initiation, the candidate passes through a mystical death, and this dissolution refers to the passing away of the old concept of separate personality. The mortal separate man must die. He must be reborn as the immortal man, one with the Father, before he may exercise his magical powers (Key 13).

New mental imagery must take the place of the old race-thought. The very idea indicated by the word "man" must be reconceived, and thus we find in the Apocalypse the statement: "To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it." (Revelation: 2:17).

Similarly, in various occult schools the initiate adopts a new name representing his highest aspiration, or the mental conception of himself which his work is intended to build into his personality (Key 3).

Yet this new name is not really new. Rather is it a reconstitution or restoration of something which has been forgotten. Thus the Chaldean Oracle admonishes us: "Explore the river of the soul, whence, or in what order, you have come; so that although you have become a servant to the body, you may rise again to the Order from which you descended, joining works to sacred reason."

Of like import is the parable of the Prodigal Son, where we read that he "came to himself." At the basis of all magical work is recollection of the real meaning and power of the Self (Key 2).

The lightning-flash of inspiration which awakens us, and at the same time overthrows our prisons of delusion, is always a flash of this self-recollection. When we remember what we really are, we escape from the bondage of the sense of separateness (Key 16).

MEDITATION: Keys 13, 3, 2, 16. Today I die to all the delusions of the past. The New Image comes to life in my heart of hearts. I recollect my true place in the universal order. I WAKEN FROM DELUSION.
