He recalls instances of seeming adversity, and sees that often the very obstacles and limitations which distressed him were the actual causes of his real advance (Key 15).

As he continues his practice of recollection and meditation, it becomes increasingly evident to him that the outer conditions of his personal experience have been always the objectifications of his mental attitudes (Key 8).

A direct consequence of this knowledge is the mental attitude of complete acquiescence. The true Initiate knows that the law is at work because he has seen it in various phases of his own life, and has observed it in the lives of others. Thus he surrenders himself to it without any reservation whatever (Key 12).

In meditation, the personal mentation, always intermittent and spasmodic, is wholly suspended. Thus a sage in *Samadhi* is in a state of trance; and in the deepest stages the trance is so complete that it counterfeits death (Key 12).

This knowledge can never be imparted adequately by human words. Only its bare outline has been given in ary occult writing. It is symbolized in Tarot by Key 8.

He recalls instances of seeming adversity, and sees that often the very obstacles and limitations which distressed him were the actual causes of his real advance (Key 15).
