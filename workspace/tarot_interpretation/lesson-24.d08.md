I reap the harvest of Yesterday and sow the seed of Tomorrow. I am in harmony with my true Self. For this day’s experience is part of the manifestation of a perfect order. I KNOW MY RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE GREAT WHOLE.

This One is the dissolver of all delusion. Steadily it moves in its progress from the darkness of the Unknown toward the sunlight of the perfect manifestation. Endlessly it reaps the fruit of the past in the field of the present. To the unwise, it wears the grisly aspect of death, but to knowers of reality it is the Great Harvester, who becomes, in another guise, the Sewer of the New Day (Key 13).

When we are so instructed, what really occurs is that we become partakers in the Lifepower's perfect memory of the significance of all that exists. The One Spirit knows, at this very instant, the exact nature of the glorious opportunity which presents itself to us in the guise of a terrifying problem. It will share that knowledge with us, if we listen.

The harmony between the two modes of personal mentality, self-consciousness and subconsciousness, and their happy relation to each other and to the superconscious Self, are the direct consequences of listening repeatedly to the Inner Voice, and of obeying its instruction. Thus comes true discrimination (Key 6).

No slightest detail of our daily lives can possibly be excluded from the sequence of Divine Manifestation. Whatever seems to be otherwise is merely evidence of temporary delusion, and even that delusion has its place in the Great Plan (Key 10).

Such knowledge is often essential to the solution of the more important problems that confront us. Furthermore, as the inverted pentagram on the Devil's head implies, every problem is fundamentally one of ignorance, and the root of all ignorance is some form of the delusion of separateness. This ignorance is to be overcome by conscious mental activity.

This transforming power has its field of operation at the self-conscious level. On the one hand, we have to be consciously and intentionally receptive to the descent of knowledge and power from superconscious levels. On the other hand, we must act intentionally and consciously as transmitters of that knowledge and power to the plane of subconsciousness. Thus the matter of primary importance, as shown by the position of the Magician in the Tarot series, and by the number on that Key, is really that of our **location** in the cosmic scheme. By this, we mean that everything depends on our appraisal of the place of human personality in the cosmic order. If we know where we are, if we understand the nature of our self-conscious mentality, if we know its powers and make right use of them, everything else follows automatically (Key 1).

I know my rightful place in the Great Whole. My inevitable destiny is release from every form of delusion. Let me have discrimination to perceive it. IN THE FIELD OF MY PERSONAL LIFE IT REAPS THE HARVEST OF YESTERDAY AND SOWS THE SEED OF TOMORROW.
