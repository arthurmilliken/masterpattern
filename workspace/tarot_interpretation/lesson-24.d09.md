TAROT INTERPRETATION
LESSON TWENTY-FOUR, DAY 9.

The keys are:

- 14
- 5
- 9
- 2

The Self directs the alchemical operation which transmutes my personality into a more adequate vehicle of its manifestation. Let me hear the Voice that expounds its true meaning. I move upward toward what I really am. THIS DAY’S THOUGHTS AND DEEDS ARE RELATED TO ALL THAT HAS EVER GONE BEFORE.

This Seer is with us always. It is the genius represented by Key 14. From it we derive all our aspirations. From it comes not only the impulse to advance, but also the power to go ahead. For the One Seer is the One Actor also, and from that One's action all our deeds are derived (Key 14).

Venus, again, as ruler of the formative and image-making power of subconsciousness, is dominant in the next Key of this series. But here her power is linked with that of the Moon, represented in Tarot by the High Priestess. If we seek to square our lives with the true order of the universe, we must invoke the power of intuition. We must learn from our observation of what is below in the field of sensation, but we cannot know the meaning of what we observe unless it be imparted to us from what Tarot pictures as the Hierophant (Key 5).

No matter what the appearance of the moment may be, each of us is in exactly the situation which, at that moment, is requisite for the expression of the perfect Order and Beauty of the One Being. Over us, ever observing our progress, stands the Silent Watcher, lighting the upward path (Key 9).

Then it happens that surrender becomes second nature. When this is accomplished, one result is that we begin to be able to read the scroll of the Universal Memory. For it is the sense of personal separateness that prevents us from doing so now. That is to say, our belief that we are separate constitutes a suggestion which is accepted by the subconscious mind, and the response to that suggestion is what keeps us from reading that part of the High Priestess' scroll which was inscribed before our physical birth into this present incarnation. As soon as we realize that our present personal life is, in all respects, continuous with the stream of universal existence, we shall begin to recover knowledge of events which occurred before the date of our birth (Key 2).

TAKEN IN REVERSE, the keys are:

- 2
- 9
- 5
- 14

This day’s thoughts and deeds are related to all that has ever gone before. Let me remember always that I advance steadily toward the heights of conscious mastery. I hear and obey the Inner Voice. THAT SELF DIRECTS THE ALCHEMICAL OPERATION WHICH TRANSMUTES MY PERSONALITY INTO A MORE ADEQUATE VEHICLE OF ITS MANIFESTATION.
