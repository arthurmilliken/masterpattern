It is not I who do this day’s work, not I who enjoy this day’s pleasures, not I who experience this days difficulties. All these events are part of the balancing of Heaven’s accounts. I am but the witness of the operation. LET ME QUIETLY OBSERVE THE PERFECT WORK.

In the earlier stages of spiritual development there is usually a strong sense of effort, even of struggle. For in those early stages the delusion of separateness is yet strong within us. But all sages testify with one voice that this sense of effort is itself delusive. It is not we who do the work. The power of the One Self carries us upward, and we are always under its beneficent supervision (Key 9).

The practical occultist learns this truth by carefully examining the record of his own past life, and by careful observation of the lives of his contemporaries. Thus he learns that every human personality is a direct expression of the law which maintains the perfect equilibrium of the cosmic order (Key 11).

A direct consequence of this knowledge is the mental attitude of complete acquiescence. The true Initiate knows that the law is at work because he has seen it in various phases of his own life, and has observed it in the lives of others. Thus he surrenders himself to it without any reservation whatever (Key 12).

This, of course, does not come all at once. There must be steady practice. The records of memory must be scanned with great care. They must be stripped of all disguise. The outcome of this occult practice, which is not unlike the catharsis employed in psycho-analysis, is to establish a harmonious reciprocal relation between the self-conscious and subconscious elements of the personal mental life. The perfected condition thus attained is represented in the symbolism of Key 6.
