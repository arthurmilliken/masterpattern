I am a direct agent of the Limitless Life. The world I see is the projection of my own mental patterns. My true Self transmutes every semblance of adversity into a moans for the perfect manifestation of my heart’s desire. I RULE MY DOMAIN.

Our power comes from above, and so do the higher Forms of knowledge, but it is at the self-conscious level of our waking life that the transformations occur. Everything constituting our environment is subject to our self-conscious thought, and is a reflection of that thought. Self-consciousness is the Magician, *is* the Transformer. We do not have to make it so, nor is occult training directed to this end. On the contrary, occult training is concerned solely with the right application of our inherent magical power (Key 1).

Thus the first lesson to learn, whenever we are confronted by any appearance of restriction, by any semblance of bondage, is that this appearance is itself a form conjured up by our own magic power . Difficult as it is to accept, the occult doctrine is unequivocal. EVERY APPEARANCE OF ADVERSITY IS BUILT UP BY MENTAL POWER WORKING THROUGH THE PERSON TO WHOM THAT APPEARANCE IS PRESENTED (Key 15).

Thus the true alchemist-magician looks upon no condition whatever as being really adverse. He has adopted what Rudolf Steiner somewhere calls the "confident attitude" toward his surroundings. He has no fear of circumstance, because he enjoys communion with the Lord of Circumstance. Thus anything which seems to be evil he regards with special interest. Like the shepherd in the New Testament parable, he is interested in these lost sheep of the House of Israel. To set in order what seems to be an example of disorder, is to treat evil as raw material for transmutation into the very forms of expression which will best suit his purpose. This is the secret of his work (Key 14),

Occult practice, in other words, does not confer magic power, nor enable one to attain it. What it does is to make us aware, through experience and reason, that we have magic power; and then such training is concerned with the orderly exercise of the power we have, to the end that by such exercise we shall see objectively around us a set of circumstances which agrees with our mentally conceived patterns (Key 4).
