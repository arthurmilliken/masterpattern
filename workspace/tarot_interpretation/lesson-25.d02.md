Because I am essentially one with the Source of all existence, all things work together for my good. The elements of my personal consciousness are in harmony with themselves and with the superconscious Life which is their Source. My personal volition is not of myself, but is a calm expression of the universal order. THE LIGHT THAT LIGHTETH EVERY MAN SHINES ON MY PATH TODAY.

This does not mean, of course, that a true theurgist, or "God-worker," has power to impose on the world around him a pattern which represents only his personal notions of the way he would like things to appear. Rather does it mean that he formulates patterns in accordance with the way things really are. He knows, in short, that he lives in a Universe on which he may depend for every good and perfect gift, and the beginning of all his projects is the recognition of the absolute dependability of the laws and forces of the universe (Key 12).

His practice leads also to perfect reciprocal activity between the self-conscious and subconscious modes of his personal mentality, and to the harmonious relation of both to the superconscious Self (Key 6).

Thus he becomes a conscious vehicle of the Life-power and his magic succeeds, because in every instance his "personal" volition is but the expression of the true cosmic order (Key 7).

"My will is to do the will of him that sent me," is an accurate expression of the genuine theurgic state of mind (Key 9).
