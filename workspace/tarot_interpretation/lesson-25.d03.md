All Nature and all her forces are my allies. The motive power of the cosmic mechanism is seated in my heart. I am the incarnate Law. THE WORD OF POWER UTTERS ITSELF WITHIN THE SANCTUARY OF MY INNER LIFE.

The real theurgist is said to tame wild beasts, because he thinks of all the forces in his environment as being essentially friendly to him. For him, Nature is never an enemy, but always an ally (Key 8).

The play of forces around him is seen to be the manifestation of the same laws which are at work in his own being; and more than this, he recognizes the highest and dominant power in the cosmic mechanism as being identical with the Principle of Individuality at the heart of his own life (Key 10).

He understands himself to be the incarnate Law, and restores the Law-giver to His rightful place on the throne in the palace of human personality (Key 11).

This understanding is his, not as a consequence of sterile speculation, not as the outcome of mere reasoning, but as the result of a vivid interior perception, which has been described in these pages as hearing the Inner Voice (Key 5).
