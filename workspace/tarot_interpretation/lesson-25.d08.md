My true Self transmutes every semblance of adversity into a means for the perfect manifestation of my heart’s desire. My personal volition is not of myself, but is a calm expression of the universal order. I am the incarnate Law. I RECOLLECT MY TRUE PLACE IN THE UNIVERSAL ORDER.

Thus the true alchemist-magician looks upon no condition whatever as being really adverse. He has adopted what Rudolf Steiner somewhere calls the "confident attitude" toward his surroundings. He has no fear of circumstance, because he enjoys communion with the Lord of Circumstance. Thus anything which seems to be evil he regards with special interest. Like the shepherd in the New Testament parable, he is interested in these lost sheep of the House of Israel. To set in order what seems to be an example of disorder, is to treat evil as raw material for transmutation into the very forms of expression which will best suit his purpose. This is the secret of his work (Key 14)

Thus he becomes a conscious vehicle of the Life-power and his magic succeeds, because in every instance his "personal" volition is but the expression of the true cosmic order (Key 7).

He understands himself to be the incarnate Law, and restores the Law-giver to His rightful place on the throne in the palace of human personality (Key 11).

Of like import is the parable of the Prodigal Son, where we read that he "came to himself." At the basis of all magical work is recollection of the real meaning and power of the Self (Key 2)

I recollect my true place in the universal order. My faith is immovable. It is ever victorious. MY TRUE SELF TRANSMUTES EVERY SEMBLANCE OF ADVERSITY INTO A MEANS FOR THE PERFECT MANIFESTATION OF MY HEART’S DESIRE.

Absolute faith is indispensable to the practical occultist. Faith established by most careful weighing of evidence, faith arrived at by most careful discrimination (Key 11).

For such a person, all need for artificial means of self-protection ceases. For him all the counsels of cowardice which the world calls "prudence" have no meaning. He rests secure in the consciousness that even at this moment his personality is a vehicle for the power of the ever-victorious Lord of Creation (Key 7).
