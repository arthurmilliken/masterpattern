TAROT INTERPRETATION
LESSON TWENTY-FOUR, DAY 3.

The keys are:

- 7
- 9
- 10
- 4

My personal life is the field of a cosmic manifestation, I move upward toward what I really am. My inevitable destiny is release from every form of delusion. PERFECT MASTERY OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS MY BIRTHRIGHT.

The third row of Keys begins with the Chariot, related to the sign Cancer, and so to the combined influences of the Moon and Jupiter. He who would meet and solve his problems must continually remind himself that his personal existence is a vehicle of expression for the universal Life-power. Our personal lives are direct expressions of the cosmic order, and manifestations of a power ever victorious (Key 7).

No matter what the appearance of the moment may be, each of us is in exactly the situation which, at that moment, is requisite for the expression of the perfect Order and Beauty of the One Being. Over us, ever observing our progress, stands the Silent Watcher, lighting the upward path (Key 9).

No slightest detail of our daily lives can possibly be excluded from the sequence of Divine Manifestation. Whatever seems to be otherwise is merely evidence of temporary delusion, and even that delusion has its place in the Great Plan (Key 10).

Not for one moment is the vigilance of the Supreme Self relaxed. Not for one moment is there any cessation of the supervision which the Life-power exercises over the whole process of its self-manifestation, and that process includes the life history of every human being (Key 4).
