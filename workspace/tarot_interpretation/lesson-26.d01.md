The beginning of his faith is in recollection. By careful examination of the memory record of his own personal experience, he learns to discern the operation of law in the events of his life. This careful examination of his own personal past is a regular part of his meditation practice. Every day, he reviews the events of that day, that he may see how the law has been manifest in those events; and he also devotes much time to examining the events of his earlier years, carrying himself back to his earliest memories (Key 2).

As a result of this practice he overcomes many of his earliest delusions. He has now the perspective of a wider experience and a higher type of knowledge. Thus he is able to see how erroneous were many of the suppositions he once mistook for truths (Key 16).

He recalls instances of seeming adversity, and sees that often the very obstacles and limitations which distressed him were the actual causes of his real advance (Key 15).

When, in addition to the practice of recollection, he adds the practice of listening to the Inner Voice, he soon begins to understand how true it is that he has been under guidance, even in those periods of his life when he seemed to be walking in utter darkness (Key 5).

MEDITATION: Keys 2, 16, 15, 5. I remember today what I really am. This recollection enables mo to destroy erroneous mental constructions. I face my problems gladly, for they are my opportunities to demonstrate power. MY LIFE THIS DAY IS A LESSON IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE HIGHER LAW.
