The vision of my joyous destiny is even now perceived by my true Self. Today I live the Law. My personal life is the field of a cosmic manifestation. FOR THIS, MY PERSONAL LIFE, IS BUT THE EARTHLY UTTERANCE OF THE HEAVENLY WORD.

"I utter myself by seeing," says The Book of Tokens, and in practical occultism we must remember always that the Heavenly Vision is the real cause of the Earthly Appearance. This physical universe is the embodiment of the mental seeing which is an essential quality of the Fiery Intelligence, pictured by the Tarot Fool. Not yet do we share that vision, for it is beheld at a level which to us is superconscious. Yet we are assured by the wise that the Spirit of Life in us is now and always the Seer of that glorious Beyond which looms up to inconceivable heights, transcending the utmost yet attained by humanity. (Key 0).

The conjoined powers of Venus and Saturn are represented by the next Key of this series. Equilibrium is always the basis of the work of the practical occultist. Never does he seek to escape from the true order of the universe. Never does he seek to evade it. Practical occultism is living the law. It is strict conformity to the way things really and truly are. This requires true imagination (Venus) and concrete embodiment of that imagery in external forms of procedure (Saturn) (Key 11).

The next Key in this series is the Chariot, related to the sign Cancer, and so to the combined influences of the Moon and Jupiter. He who would meet and solve his problems must continually remind himself that his personal existence is a vehicle of expression for the universal Life-power. Our personal lives are direct expressions of the cosmic order, and manifestations of a power ever victorious (Key 7).

This brings us to the Hanged Man, symbol of the utter dependence of personal existence upon the support of the great Tree of Universal Life. The message of this Key is, here as always, the truth that we must make conscious surrender of even the least details of personal existence to the supervision of the Life-power. We must practice this, because it does not "come natural". All the superficial evidence of the senses is against it, and to overcome the influence of this sensory illusion, together with the hypnosis of delusion which affects the race mind with the sense of separateness, continual repetition of the conscious attitude of surrender is required (Key 12).
