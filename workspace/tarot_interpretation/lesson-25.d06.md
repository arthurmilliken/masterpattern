The Spirit of Life which I am, rules all things. It is ever victorious. It is even now the master of every condition. THIS DAY I DISSOLVE ALL ILLUSION.

It cannot be said too often that magic effects no change whatever in the essential nature of things. Neither does it modify in the least the orderly sequence of cosmic manifestation, The magician awakens himself from a dream of delusion, that is all. He changes his point-of-view. He stops thinking of the world as his adversary, stops seeing it as something opposed to his will, instead, he sees it as his domain, as the instrument of his self-expression, as something subordinate to the Spirit within him which is his true Self.

Seeing it thus, he so experiences it (Key 4).

For such a person, all need for artificial means of self-protection ceases. For him all the counsels of cowardice which the world calls "prudence" have no meaning. He rests secure in the consciousness that even at this moment his personality is a vehicle for the power of the ever-victorious Lord of Creation (Key 7).

He has transferred his consciousness from the outer rim of the Wheel of Fortune, with its succession of ups and downs, to the spiritual center where there are no fluctuations (Key 10).

Not even death can frighten him, for when he has arrived at this state of consciousness he has made contact with that which is unaffected by any external change whatever. In that contact he finds that even death is an aspect of the activity of the One Self. For the skeleton reaper of Key 13 is, in fact, a representation of the transforming power of that Self, even as the other Keys of the series are representations of other aspects of the same power (Key 13).
