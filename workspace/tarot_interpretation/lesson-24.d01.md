"I utter myself by seeing," says The Book of Tokens, and in practical occultism we must remember always that the Heavenly Vision is the real cause of the Earthly Appearance. This physical universe is the embodiment of the mental seeing which is an essential quality of the Fiery Intelligence, pictured by the Tarot Fool. Not yet do we share that vision, for it is beheld at a level which to us is superconscious. Yet we are assured by the wise that the Spirit of Life in us is now and always the Seer of that glorious Beyond which looms up to inconceivable heights, transcending the utmost yet attained by humanity. (Key 0).

This Seer is with us always. It is the genius represented by Key 14. From it we derive all our aspirations. From it comes not only the impulse to advance, but also the power to go ahead. For the One Seer is the One Actor also, and from that One's action all our deeds are derived (Key 14).

Again, this One is the dissolver of all delusion. Steadily it moves in its progress from the darkness of the Unknown toward the sunlight of the perfect manifestation. Endlessly it reaps the fruit of the past in the field of the present. To the unwise, it wears the grisly aspect of death, but to knowers of reality it is the Great Harvester, who becomes, in another guise, the Sewer of the New Day (Key 13).

The seed thus sown springs up in the rich fruitage of ideas and forms suggested by the ripening grain at the feet of the Empress. Even so, among the letters we are now considering, does Daleth, symbol of the womb, follow Nun, which has for centuries upon centuries represented the Martian, phallic, masculine power.

Thus our first series of Keys in this tableau ends with a Key corresponding to the fruitful mother, Venus. It is related psychologically to the creative function of subconsciousness (Key 3).

---

Vision, experiment, action, and the formulation of new mental patterns are suggested by this series of Keys. Students who are familiar with astrology should note that the planetary sequence represented consists of the iconoclastic Uranus, the expansive and orderly Jupiter, the transforming and disintegrating Mars, and the formative and integrating Venus.

MEDITATION: Keys 0, 14, 13, 3. The vision of my joyous destiny is even now perceived by my true Self, That Self directs the alchemical operation which transmutes my personality into a more adequate vehicle of its manifestation. In the field of my personal life it reaps the harvest of Yesterday and sows the seed of Tomorrow. MY EARTHLY LIFE TODAY IS THE REALIZATION OF HEAVENLY PATTERNS.
