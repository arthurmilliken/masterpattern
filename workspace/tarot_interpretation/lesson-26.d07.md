When, in addition to the practice of recollection, he adds the practice of listening to the Inner Voice, he soon begins to understand how true it is that he has been under guidance, even in those periods of his life when he seemed to be walking in utter darkness (Key 5).

Furthermore, he discovers that even those mental attitudes which were pain-bearing were beneficent, in that they brought him corrective experience. Then he sees that even his mental unfoldment is a cosmic as well as a personal process. He traces his progress upward from earlier states of comparative ignorance to his present stage of better understanding, and perceives that every step was inevitable. From then on he has no doubt of the perfect completion of the process (Key 10).

This, of course, does not come all at once. There must be steady practice. The records of memory must be scanned with great care. They must be stripped of all disguise. The outcome of this occult practice, which is not unlike the catharsis employed in psycho-analysis, is to establish a harmonious reciprocal relation between the self-conscious and subconscious elements of the personal mental life. The perfected condition thus attained is represented in the symbolism of Key 6.

Truth itself is identical with the One Spirit, and though it may seem to us, at first, that we uncover truth by meditation, the time will come when we understand that we are disposed by the One Self to adopt the practice of meditation. Thus we begin to realize that any man in meditation is merely a specific example of the method whereby the real nature of the One Life unveils itself to human consciousness, God in us unveils Himself to Himself (Key 17).

Thus when Patanjali says meditation is an unbroken flow of knowledge in a particular object, reflection makes it evident that true meditation is participation in the One Spirit's unbroken flow of knowledge in all things. Really to meditate, then, is to be identified, during meditation, with the Divine Consciousness of some aspect of reality. This, indeed, is why all genuine occult literature lays so much stress on the importance of meditation (Key 17)

This, of course, does not come all at once. There must be steady practice. The records of memory must be scanned with great care. They must be stripped of all disguise. The outcome of this occult practice, which is not unlike the catharsis employed in psycho-analysis, is to establish a harmonious reciprocal relation between the self-conscious and subconscious elements of the personal mental life. The perfected condition thus attained is represented in the symbolism of Key 6.

Furthermore, he discovers that even those mental attitudes which were pain-bearing were beneficent, in that they brought him corrective experience. Then he sees that even his mental unfoldment is a cosmic as well as a personal process. He traces his progress upward from earlier states of comparative ignorance to his present stage of better understanding, and perceives that every step was inevitable. From then on he has no doubt of the perfect completion of the process (Key 10).

Recall, then, what was said early in this lesson. The beginning of meditation is careful examination of the memory record of your personal existence. Combined with this must be the attitude of listening for the comment of the Inner Voice, as it explains the significance of that record. This must be a daily practice (Key 5).
