TAROT INTERPRETATION
LESSON TWENTY-SEVEN, DAY 1.

The keys are:

-  3
- 17
- 16
-  6

The harvest of wisdom ripens in the field of my subconsciousness. Day by day my vision of truth becomes clearer. I welcome the overthrow of my former errors. THE OVERSHADOWING PRESENCE DISPOSES ME TO FAITHFULNESS.

---

Seeing truly is as much an act of imagination as it is a manifestation of the laws of optics. Our physical vision has to be supplemented by mental imagery (Key 3).

The perception of true relationships is supersensual, the consequence of meditation. To see truly requires the correlation of all our senses, and the sublimation of their reports into a higher order of knowing (Key 17).

From superficial sense knowledge we gain only material for a structure of error, certain sooner or later to be overthrown by a sudden influx of light from superconscious levels (Key 16).

The balance of conscious and subconscious activities symbolized by the Lovers cannot be maintained while the sense of separateness persists, for while we are imprisoned in that delusion the conscious and subconscious phases of our personal mentality are, so to say, in disguise. Thus the falling figures in Key 16 are shown clothed, but in Key 6 the man and the woman are nude, to show that neither hides anything from the other.
