My true Self transmutes every semblance of adversity into a moans for the perfect manifestation of my heartâ€™s desire. My personal volition is not of myself, but is a calm expression of the universal order. I am the incarnate Law. I RECOLLECT MY TRUE PLACE IN THE UNIVERSAL ORDER.

Thus the first lesson to learn, whenever we are confronted by any appearance of restriction, by any semblance of bondage, is that this appearance is itself a form conjured up by our own magic power . Difficult as it is to accept, the occult doctrine is unequivocal. EVERY APPEARANCE OF ADVERSITY IS BUILT UP BY MENTAL POWER WORKING THROUGH THE PERSON TO WHOM THAT APPEARANCE IS PRESENTED (Key 15).

His practice leads also to perfect reciprocal activity between the self-conscious and subconscious modes of his personal mentality, and to the harmonious relation of both to the superconscious Self (Key 6).

The play of forces around him is seen to be the manifestation of the same laws which are at work in his own being; and more than this, he recognizes the highest and dominant power in the cosmic mechanism as being identical with the Principle of Individuality at the heart of his own life (Key 10).

New mental imagery must take the place of the old race-thought. The very idea indicated by the word "man" must be reconceived, and thus we find in the Apocalypse the statement: "To him that overcometh I will give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it." (Revelation: 2:17).

Similarly, in various occult schools the initiate adopts a new name representing his highest aspiration, or the mental conception of himself which his work is intended to build into his personality (Key 3). Yet this new name is not really new. Rather is it a reconstitution or restoration of something which has been forgotten. Thus the Chaldean Oracle admonishes us: "Explore the river of the soul, whence, or in what order, you have come; so that although you have become a servant to the body, you may rise again to the Order from which you descended, joining works to sacred reason."

MEDITATION: Keys 15, 6, 10, 3. The world I see is the projection of my own mental patterns. The elements of my personal consciousness are in harmony with themselves and with the superconscious Life which is their Source. The motive power of the cosmic mechanism is seated in my heart. THE NEW IMAGE COMES TO LIFE IN MY HEART OF HEARTS.

The new image comes to life in my heart of hearts. It is even now the master of every condition. For I know what must appear as the inevitable consequence of what I have already discovered. THE WORLD I SEE IS THE PROJECTION OF MY OWN MENTAL PATTERNS.

He has transferred his consciousness from the outer rim of the Wheel of Fortune, with its succession of ups and downs, to the spiritual center where there are no fluctuations (Key 10).

Such faith is established when persistent effort has made subconsciousness a clear mirror, reflecting superconscious knowledge into the field of self-consciousness (Key 6).
