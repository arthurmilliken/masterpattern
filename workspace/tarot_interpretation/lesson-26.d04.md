It will not escape the attention of the alert student that right meditation is really the work which leads to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. More, whenever right meditation is established, one perceives that the personal life is, and has been always, an alchemical operation directed by that Angel, That is to say, it is not we who make progress, but rather that our improved state of consciousness, with its accompanying increase in our ability to control the conditions of our environment, is the outcome of the operation of the true Self upon its vehicle, our personality.

There is a hint of this in the words of Jesus: "I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me." For these words imply the presence of a power superior to the personal man Jesus, and that power, which Jesus called "Father," is truly the Divine Operator who tempers our personal chemistry so that we become more suitable vehicles for expressing what It really is (Key 14).

No part of our personal equipment is separate from the universal Being. Do we see things as they really are? Then we are but sharing the Divine Vision. Our personal command of circumstance is none other than the Universal Dominion, expressed in the conditions of time and space which constitute our personal environment (Key 4).

Even the subconscious gestation of mental images, in consequence of which new ideas come into being within our field of personal awareness, is really a universal process. For there is no plane of being where the universal Life-power is not present, nor is there any phase of activity in which it is not the real Actor (Key 3).

Truth itself is identical with the One Spirit, and though it may seem to us, at first, that we uncover truth by meditation, the time will come when we understand that we are disposed by the One Self to adopt the practice of meditation. Thus we begin to realize that any man in meditation is merely a specific example of the method whereby the real nature of the One Life unveils itself to human consciousness, God in us unveils Himself to Himself (Key 17).
