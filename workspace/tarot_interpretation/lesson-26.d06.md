The keys are:

-  5
-  8
- 11
- 14

Recall, then, what was said early in this lesson. The beginning of meditation is careful examination of the memory record of your personal existence. Combined with this must be the attitude of listening for the comment of the Inner Voice, as it explains the significance of that record. This must be a daily practice (Key 5).

The result will be that you will gain knowledge of the Great Secret. This knowledge can never be imparted adequately by human words. Only its bare outline has been given in ary occult writing. It is symbolized in Tarot by Key 8.

From the inner revelation of this Great Secret, the practical occultist derives his open-eyed, magical faith (Key 11).

The immediate outcome of that faith is what medieval writers on magic called the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. To know that Guiding Presence, to share in its perception, to receive through it the wisdom and power of the Pure Spirit -— this is the consequence of meditation (Key 14).

MEDITATION: Keys 5, 8, 11, 14. Be Thou my Guide, O Teacher of all teachers! Let me be strong in Thy strength. Let me be faithful in act, in thought, in word. I AM OVERSHADOWED BY THE PROTECTING PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY.
