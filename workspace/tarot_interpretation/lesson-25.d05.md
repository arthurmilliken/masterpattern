I dare to be what I truly am. My faith is immovable. For I know what must appear as the inevitable consequence of what I have already discovered. IT IS MY PREROGATIVE TO BE AN ADMINISTRATOR OF THE COSMIC WILL.

Nearly always our errors have their roots in fear; and generally these fears are part of the race inheritance. The occult point-of-view is just the reverse of what common sense, so-called, dictates. The fourfold occult maxim runs. KNOW, WILL, DARE, BE SILENT; but the race mind has little courage. Popular proverbs disguise cowardice as prudence, and we are all more or less infected by this poison (Key 16).

Absolute faith is indispensable to the practical occultist. Faith established by most careful weighing of evidence, faith arrived at by most careful discrimination (Key 11).

Such faith is established when persistent effort has made subconsciousness a clear mirror, reflecting superconscious knowledge into the field of self-consciousness (Key 6).

The beginning of such discrimination is the mental attitude the Magician typifies--continual endeavor to keep in touch with the power source above the conscious level, combined with habitual alertness. This is the fruit of long practice in concentration, directed steadily to watchful consideration of every detail of self-conscious experience (Key 1).
