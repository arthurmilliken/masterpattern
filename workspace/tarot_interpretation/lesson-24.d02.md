TAROT INTERPRETATION
LESSON TWENTY-FOUR, DAY 2.

The keys are:

- 11
- 5
- 6
- 8

The conjoined powers of Venus and Saturn are represented by the Key beginning the second row. Equilibrium is always the basis of the work of the practical occultist. Never does he seek to escape from the true order of the universe. Never does he seek to evade it. Practical occultism is living the law. It is strict conformity to the way things really and truly are. This requires true imagination (Venus) and concrete embodiment of that imagery in external forms of procedure (Saturn) (Key 11).

Venus, again, as ruler of the formative and image-making power of subconsciousness, is dominant in second Key of this row. But here her power is linked with that of the Moon, represented in Tarot by the High Priestess. If we seek to square our lives with the true order of the universe, we must invoke the power of intuition. We must learn from our observation of what is below in the field of sensation, but we cannot know the meaning of what we observe unless it be imparted to us from what Tarot pictures as the Hierophant (Key 5).

When we are so instructed, what really occurs is that we become partakers in the Lifepower's perfect memory of the significance of all that exists. The One Spirit knows, at this very instant, the exact nature of the glorious opportunity which presents itself to us in the guise of a terrifying problem. It will share that knowledge with us, if we listen. Thus, and thus only, may we attain that fine balance of personal mental powers represented by the third Key of this second row.

The harmony between the two modes of personal mentality, self-consciousness and subconsciousness, and their happy relation to each other and to the superconscious Self, are the direct consequences of listening repeatedly to the Inner Voice, and of obeying its instruction. Thus comes true discrimination (Key 6), and the ability to use the law represented by the last card of the second row.

When we are always obedient to the Inner Voice, the suggestions transmitted to the human level of subconsciousness are symbolized by the woman in Key 8. They are always constructive, and they descend automatically to the subhuman levels typified by the lion. We do not have to trouble ourselves about this transmission. It works perfectly without any conscious interference on our part. All the powers of nature obey us without question, when we obey the Inner Voice. This, in the plainest of language, is the Great Secret of practical occultism (Key 8).

MEDITATION: Keys 11, 5, 6, 8. Today I live the Law. I hear and obey the Inner Voice, Consciously and subconsciously, I am in harmony with my true Self. ALL POWER IS GIVEN ME OF MY FATHER IN HEAVEN.

Venus, as ruler of the formative and image-making power of subconsciousness, is dominant in the next Key of this row. But here her power is linked with that of the Moon, represented in Tarot by the High Priestess. If we seek to square our lives with the true order of the universe, we must invoke the power of intuition. We must learn from our observation of what is below in the field of sensation, but we cannot know the meaning of what we observe unless it be imparted to us from what Tarot pictures as the Hierophant (Key 5).

The conjoined powers of Venus and Saturn are represented by the final Key in the second row. Equilibrium is always the basis of the work of the practical occultist. Never does he seek to escape from the true order of the universe. Never does he seek to evade it. Practical occultism is living the law. It is strict conformity to the way things really and truly are. This requires true imagination (Venus) and concrete embodiment of that imagery in external forms of procedure (Saturn) (Key 11).
