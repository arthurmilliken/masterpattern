The seed thus sown springs up in the rich fruitage of ideas and forms suggested by the ripening grain at the feet of the Empress. Thus our first key in this series corresponds to the fruitful mother, Venus. It is related psychologically to the creative function of subconsciousness and the formulation of new mental patterns (Key 3).

Suggestions transmitted to the human level of subconsciousness are symbolized by the woman in Key 8. They are always constructive, and they descend automatically to the subhuman levels typified by the lion. We do not have to trouble ourselves about this transmission. It works perfectly without any conscious interference on our part. All the powers of nature obey us without question, when we obey the Inner Voice. This, in the plainest of language, is the Great Secret of practical occultism (Key 8).

Not for one moment is the vigilance of the Supreme Self relaxed. Not for one moment is there any cessation of the supervision which the Life-power exercises over the whole process of its self-manifestation, and that process includes the life history of every human being (Key 4).

This may sound almost too easy, but we must remember that the great Masters all declare, with Jesus: "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light." This should be borne in mind, also, as we consider the final Key of this series. The fearsome aspect of the Devil is nothing but delusion. There is no reality in the universe corresponding to this dreadful figure. For the perfect knowledge of the Life-power there are no problems whatever, nor any ignorance at all. The true Self of you, at this very moment, knows just what you must do to be free from whatever form of bondage seems now to limit you. Mentally relate yourself to that liberating power, and you will find the solution of the problem (Key 15).
