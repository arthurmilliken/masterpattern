TAROT INTERPRETATION
LESSON TWENTY-FOUR.

The Keys are:

- 3
- 6
- 9
- 12

The door of opportunity opens to me today. Let me have discrimination to perceive it. Let me remember always that I advance steadily toward the heights of conscious mastery. FOR THIS, MY PERSONAL LIFE, IS BUT THE EARTHLY UTTERANCE OF THE HEAVENLY WORD.

The seed thus sown springs up in the rich fruitage of ideas and forms suggested by the ripening grain at the feet of the Empress. Thus our series of Keys begins with a Key corresponding to the fruitful mother, Venus. It is related psychologically to the creative function of subconsciousness (Key 3).

When we are so instructed, what really occurs is that we become partakers in the Lifepower's perfect memory of the significance of all that exists. The One Spirit knows, at this very instant, the exact nature of the glorious opportunity which presents itself to us in the guise of a terrifying problem. Thus, and thus only, may we attain that fine balance of personal mental powers represented by the next Key.

The harmony between the two modes of personal mentality, self-consciousness and subconsciousness, and their happy relation to each other and to the superconscious Self, are the direct consequences of listening repeatedly to the Inner Voice, and of obeying its instruction. Thus comes true discrimination (Key 6), and the ability to use the law represented by the next Key in this series.

No matter what the appearance of the moment may be, each of us is in exactly the situation which, at that moment, is requisite for the expression of the perfect Order and Beauty of the One Being. Over us, ever observing our progress, stands the Silent Watcher, lighting the upward path (Key 9).

Thus the final Key in this series is the Hanged Man, symbol of the utter dependence of personal existence upon the support of the great Tree of Universal Life. The message of this Key is, here as always, the truth that we must make conscious surrender of even the least details of personal existence to the supervision of the Life-power. We must practice this, because it does not "come natural". All the superficial evidence of the senses is against it, and to overcome the influence of this sensory illusion, together with the hypnosis of delusion which affects the race mind with the sense of separateness, continual repetition of the conscious attitude of surrender is required (Key 12).

My personal life is but the earthly utterance of the heavenly word. Let me remember always that I advance steadily toward the heights of conscious mastery. Let me have discrimination to perceive it. THE DOOR OF OPPORTUNITY OPENS TO ME TODAY.

The One Spirit knows, at this very instant, the exact nature of the glorious opportunity which presents itself to us in the guise of a terrifying problem. It will share that knowledge with us, if we listen. Thus, and thus only, may we attain that fine balance of personal mental powers represented by the next Key.

The harmony between the two modes of personal mentality, self-consciousness and subconsciousness, and their happy relation to each other and to the superconscious Self, are the direct consequences of listening repeatedly to the Inner Voice, and of obeying its instruction. Thus comes true discrimination (Key 6).

The seed thus sown springs up in the rich fruitage of ideas and forms suggested by the ripening grain at the feet of the Empress. Even so, among the letters we are now considering, does Daleth, symbol of the womb, follow Nun, which has for centuries upon centuries represented the Martian, phallic, masculine power.

Thus our series ends with a Key corresponding to the fruitful mother, Venus. It is related psychologically to the creative function of subconsciousness (Key 3).
