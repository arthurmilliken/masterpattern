The beginning of his faith is in recollection. By careful examination of the memory record of his own personal experience, he learns to discern the operation of law in the events of his life. This careful examination of his own personal past is a regular part of his meditation practice. Every day, he reviews the events of that day, that he may see how the law has been manifest in those events; and he also devotes much time to examining the events of his earlier years, carrying himself back to his earliest memories (Key 2).

Thus he begins to understand the working of the law of transformation. He learns the futility of the ignorant desire to keep conditions as they are. He sees how the law of eternal progress demands that old forms must give place to new. Thus he comes eventually to discover the mystery of life behind the veil of death, for one certain result of meditation is recovery of definite memories of past incarnations, and once the student has seen for himself that his present life is but one of a series, all fear of death leaves him (Key 13).

In the earlier stages of spiritual development there is usually a strong sense of effort, even of struggle. For in those early stages the delusion of separateness is yet strong within us. But all sages testify with one voice that this sense of effort is itself delusive. It is not we who do the work. The power of the One Self carries us upward, and we are always under its beneficent supervision (Key 9).

It will not escape the attention of the alert student that right meditation is really the work which leads to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. More, whenever right meditation is established, one perceives that the personal life is, and has been always, an alchemical operation directed by that Angel, That is to say, it is not we who make progress, but rather that our improved state of consciousness, with its accompanying increase in our ability to control the conditions of our environment, is the outcome of the operation of the true Self upon its vehicle, our personality.

There is a hint of this in the words of Jesus: "I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.” For these words imply the presence of a power superior to the personal man Jesus, and that power, which Jesus called "Father,” is truly the Divine Operator who tempers our personal chemsitry so that we become more suitable vehicles for expressing what It really is (Key 14).

The immediate outcome of that faith is what medieval writers on magic called the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. To know that Guiding Presence, to share in its perception, to receive through it the wisdom and power of the Pure Spirit -— this is the consequence of meditation (Key 14).

In the earlier stages of spiritual development there is usually a strong sense of effort, even of struggle. For in those early stages the delusion of separateness is yet strong within us. But all sages testify with one voice that this sense of effort is itself delusive. It is not we who do the work. The power of the One Self carries us upward, and we are always under its beneficent supervision (Key 9).

"For such an one has, in Samadhi, remembered what he really is, and the glory and power of that recollection manifest themselves" (Key 2)
