The fourth row of Keys begins with the Hanged Man, symbol of the utter dependence of personal existence upon the support of the great Tree of Universal Life. The message of this Key is, here as always, the truth that we must make conscious surrender of even the least details of personal existence to the supervision of the Life-power. We must practice this, because it does not "come natural". All the superficial evidence of the senses is against it, and to overcome the influence of this sensory illusion, together with the hypnosis of delusion which affects the race mind with the sense of separateness, continual repetition of the conscious attitude of surrender is required (Key 12).

Then it happens that surrender becomes second nature. When this is accomplished, one result is that we begin to be able to read the scroll of the Universal Memory. For it is the sense of personal separateness that prevents us from doing so now. That is to say, our belief that we are separate constitutes a suggestion which is accepted by the subconscious mind, and the response to that suggestion is what keeps us from reading that part of the High Priestess' scroll which was inscribed before our physical birth into this present incarnation. As soon as we realize that our present personal life is, in all respects, continuous with the stream of universal existence, we shall begin to recover knowledge of events which occurred before the date of our birth (Key 2).

Such knowledge is often essential to the solution of the more important problems that confront us. Furthermore, as the inverted pentagram on the Devil's head implies, every problem is fundamentally one of ignorance, and the root of all ignorance is some form of the delusion of separateness. This ignorance is to be overcome by conscious mental activity, at the level represented by the third Key in the fourth row of the square.

The transforming power has its field of operation at the self-conscious level. On the one hand, we have to be consciously and intentionally receptive to the descent of knowledge and power from superconscious levels. On the other hand, we must act intentionally and consciously as transmitters of that knowledge and power to the plane of subconsciousness. Thus the matter of primary importance, as shown by the position of the Magician in the Tarot series, and by the number on that Key, is really that of our **location** in the cosmic scheme. By this, we mean that everything depends on our appraisal of the place of human personality in the cosmic order. If we know where we are, if we understand the nature of our self-conscious mentality, if we know its powers and make right use of them, everything else follows automatically (Key 1).

This may sound almost too easy, but we must remember that the great Masters all declare, with Jesus: "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light." This should be borne in mind, also, as we consider the final Key of this series. The fearsome aspect of the Devil is nothing but delusion. There is no reality in the universe corresponding to this dreadful figure. For the perfect knowledge of the Life-power there are no problems whatever, nor any ignorance at all. The true Self of you, at this very moment, knows just what you must do to be free from whatever form of bondage seems now to limit you. Mentally relate yourself to that liberating power, and you will find the solution of the problem (Key 15).
