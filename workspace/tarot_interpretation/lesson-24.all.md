TAROT INTERPRETATION
LESSON TWENTY-FOUR.

The Tarot tableau for this lesson, is:

     3  13  14   0
     8   6   5  11
     4  10   9   7
    15   1   2  12

Lay out the Keys as above. Inspect the tableau before you begin reading the lesson. The combinations are different from those to which you are accustomed. Let your subconsciousness receive the impression of the whole tableau at first. Then see what you can discover concerning its details, before turning this page.

This is the first of the seven "Jupiter" magic squares, on which this lesson and the next six will be based. It is a symmetrical arrangement of numbers, from which is derived a magical figure called the Sigil of Jupiter.

The sigil is made by connecting the central points of the sixteen cells of a Jupiter square. The center of the square numbered 0 is the beginning and end of the line forming the sigil. Straight lines connect the centers of the cells, in the order of the numbers from 0 to 15. The resultant figure is shewn below. In ceremonial and talismanic magic this figure is employed in operations of Jupiter, It is then drawn with violet ink, paint or crayon, (See next page).

There are other magic squares of sixteen numbers, but this particular arrangement has been handed down to us as having special potency in Jupiter ian operations. Its harmonious character, considered merely as a balanced system of lines, is obvious at a glance.

In these Jupiter squares, notice that the first and third, and second and fourth numbers on the diagonal lines are extremes, whose mean term is shown by the number between them. On the diagonal running from the upper right corner to the lower left, 0 and 10 are extremes balanced by 5, and 5 and 15 are extremes balanced by 10, On the other diagonal 3 and 9 are extremes balanced by 6, while 6 and 12 are balanced by 9.

Again, the sum of any two numbers diametrically opposed, as 0 and 15, 1 and 14, 4 and 11, or 7 and 8, is always the same. In this square, this constant total is always 15, Thus the whole square corresponds to the first stage of spiritual unfoldment, represented by Key 15. Thus we know that this square has to do with the initial recognition of bondage, the facing of a problem. It is connected also with the Qabalistic ideas related to the 26th path on the Tree of Life, termed Renewing Intelligence.

In meditations for this lesson, and the next six, the fundamental ideas will be taken from the four horizontal and two diagonal rows of Keys. We shall make use also of ideas suggested by the Qabalistic meanings of the letters corresponding to the Keys. In reading the horizontal rows, we shall follow the Hebrew order, from right to left. The diagonal row from upper right to lower left will be read from bottom to top, and the other diagonal will be read from the upper left to the lower right.

"I utter myself by seeing," says The Book of Tokens, and in practical occultism we must remember always that the Heavenly Vision is the real cause of the Earthly Appearance. This physical universe is the embodiment of the mental seeing which is an essential quality of the Fiery Intelligence, pictured by the Tarot Fool. Not yet do we share that vision, for it is beheld at a level which to us is superconscious. Yet we are assured by the wise that the Spirit of Life in us is now and always the Seer of that glorious Beyond which looms up to inconceivable heights, transcending the utmost yet attained by humanity. (Key 0).

This Seer is with us always. It is the genius represented by Key 14. From it we derive all our aspirations. From it comes not only the impulse to advance, but also the power to go ahead. For the One Seer is. the One Actor also, and from that One's action all our deeds are derived (Key 14).

Again, this One is the dissolver of all delusion. Steadily it moves in its progress from the darkness of the Unknown toward the sunlight of the perfect manifestation. Endlessly it reaps the fruit of the past in the field of the present. To the unwise, it wears the grisly aspect of death, but to knowers of reality it is the Great Harvester, who becomes, in another guise, the Sewer of the New Day (Key 13).

The seed thus sown springs up in the rich fruitage of ideas and forms suggested by the ripening grain at the feet of the Empress. Even so, among the letters we are now considering, does Daleth, symbol of the womb, follow Nun, which has for centuries upon centuries represented the Martian, phallic, masculine power.

Thus our first series of Keys in this tableau ends with a Key corresponding to the fruitful mother, Venus. It is related psychologically to the creative function of subconsciousness (Key 3).

Vision, experiment, action, and the formulation of new mental patterns are suggested by this series of Keys. Students who are familiar with astrology should note that the planetary sequence represented consists of the iconoclastic Uranus, the expansive and orderly Jupiter, the transforming and disintegrating Mars, and the formative and integrating Venus.

The conjoined powers of Venus and Saturn are represented by the Key beginning the second row. Equilibrium is always the basis of the work of the practical occultist. Never does he seek to escape from the true order of the universe. Never does he seek to evade it. Practical occultism is living the law. It is strict conformity to the way things really and truly are. This requires true imagination (Venus) and concrete embodiment of that imagery in external forms of procedure (Saturn) (Key 11).

Venus, again, as ruler of the formative and image-making power of subconsciousness, is dominant in second Key of this row. But here her power is linked with that of the Moon, represented in Tarot by the High Priestess. If we seek to square our lives with the true order of the universe, we must invoke the power of intuition. We must learn from our observation of what is below in the field of sensation, but we cannot know the meaning of what we observe unless it be imparted to us from what Tarot pictures as the Hierophant (Key 5).

When we are so instructed, what really occurs is that we become partakers in the Lifepower's perfect memory of the significance of all that exists. The One Spirit knows, at this very instant, the exact nature of the glorious opportunity which presents itself to us in the guise of a terrifying problem. It will share that knowledge with us, if we listen. Thus, and thus only, may we attain that fine balance of personal mental powers represented by the third Key of this second row.

The harmony between the two modes of personal mentality, self-consciousness and subconsciousness, and their happy relation to each other and to the superconscious Self, are the direct consequences of listening repeatedly to the Inner Voice, and of obeying its instruction. Thus comes true discrimination (Key 6), and the ability to use the law represented by the last card of the second row.

When we are always obedient to the Inner Voice, the suggestions transmitted to the human level of subconsciousness are symbolized by the woman in Key 8. They are always constructive, and they descend automatically to the subhuman levels typified by the lion. We do not have to trouble ourselves about this transmission. It works perfectly without any conscious interference on our part. All the powers of nature obey us without question, when we obey the Inner Voice. This, in the plainest of language, is the Great Secret of practical occultism (Key 8).

The third row of Keys begins with the Chariot, related to the sign Cancer, and so to the combined influences of the Moon and Jupiter. He who would meet and solve his problems must continually remind himself that his personal existence is a vehicle of expression for the universal Life-power. Our personal lives are direct expressions of the cosmic order, and manifestations of a power ever victorious (Key 7).

No matter what the appearance of the moment may be, each of us is in exactly the situation which, at that moment, is requisite for the expression of the perfect Order and Beauty of the One Being. Over us, ever observing our progress, stands the Silent Watcher, lighting the upward path (Key 9).

No slightest detail of our daily lives can possibly be excluded from the sequence of Divine Manifestation. Whatever seems to be otherwise is merely evidence of temporary delusion, and even that delusion has its place in the Great Plan (Key 10).

Not for one moment is the vigilance of the Supreme Self relaxed. Not for one moment is there any cessation of the supervision which the Life-power exercises over the whole process of its self-manifestation, and that process includes the life history of every human being (Key 4).

---

Thus the fourth row of Keys begins with the Hanged Man, symbol of the utter dependence of personal existence upon the support of the great Tree of Universal Life. The message of this Key is, here as always, the truth that we must make conscious surrender of even the least details of personal existence to the supervision of the Life-power. We must practice this, because it does not "come natural". All the superficial evidence of the senses is against it, and to overcome the influence of this sensory illusion, together with the hypnosis of delusion which affects the race mind with the sense of separateness, continual repetition of the conscious attitude of surrender is required (Key 12).

Then it happens that surrender becomes second nature. When this is accomplished, one result is that we begin to be able to read the scroll of the Universal Memory. For it is the sense of personal separateness that prevents us from doing so now. That is to say, our belief that we are separate constitutes a suggestion which is accepted by the subconscious mind, and the response to that suggestion is what keeps us from reading that part of the High Priestess' scroll which was inscribed before our physical birth into this present incarnation. As soon as we realize that our present personal life is, in all respects, continuous with the stream of universal existence, we shall begin to recover knowledge of events which occurred before the date of our birth (Key 2).

Such knowledge is often essential to the solution of the more important problems that confront us. Furthermore, as the inverted pentagram on the Devil's head implies, every problem is fundamentally one of ignorance, and the root of all ignorance is some form of the delusion of separateness. This ignorance is to be overcome by conscious mental activity, at the level represented by the third Key in the fourth row of the square.

The transforming power has its field of operation at the self-conscious level. On the one hand, we have to be consciously and intentionally receptive to the descent of knowledge and power from superconscious levels. On the other hand, we must act intentionally and consciously as transmitters of that knowledge and power to the plane of subconsciousness. Thus the matter of primary importance, as shown by the position of the Magician in the Tarot series, and by the number on that Key, is really that of our **location** in the cosmic scheme. By this, we mean that everything depends on our appraisal of the piece of human personality in the cosmic order. If we know where we are, if we understand the nature of our self-conscious mentality, if we know its powers and make right use of them, everything else follows automatically (Key 1).

This may sound almost too easy, but we must remember that the great Masters all declare, with Jesus: "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light." This should be borne in mind, also, as we consider the final Key of this series. The fearsome aspect of the Devil is nothing but delusion. There is no reality in the universe corresponding to this dreadful figure. For the perfect knowledge of the Life-power there are no problems whatever, nor any ignorance at all. The true Self of you, at this very moment, knows just what you must do to be free from whatever form of bondage seems now to limit you. Mentally relate yourself to that liberating power, and you will find the solution of the problem (Key 15).
