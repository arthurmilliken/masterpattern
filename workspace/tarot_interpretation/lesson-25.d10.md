I am a direct agent of the Limitless Life. Because I am essentially one with the Source of all existence, all things work together for my good. All Nature and all her forces are my allies. TODAY I DIE TO ALL THE DELUSIONS OF THE PAST.

Our power comes from above, and so do the higher Forms of knowledge, but it is at the self-conscious level of our waking life that the transformations occur. Everything constituting our environment is subject to our self-conscious thought, and is a reflection of that thought. Self-consciousness is the Magician, *is* the Transformer. We do not have to make it so, nor is occult training directed to this end. On the contrary, occult training is concerned solely with the right application of our inherent magical power (Key 1).

This does not mean, of course, that a true theurgist, or "God-worker," has power to impose on the world around him a pattern which represents only his personal notions of the way he would like things to appear. Rather does it mean that he formulates patterns in accordance with the way things really are. He knows, in short, that he lives in a Universe on which he may depend for every good and perfect gift, and the beginning of all his projects is the recognition of the absolute dependability of the laws and forces of the universe (Key 12).

The real theurgist is said to tame wild beasts, because he thinks of all the forces in his environment as being essentially friendly to him. For him, Nature is never an enemy, but always an ally (Key 8).

In every ritual of initiation, the candidate passes through a mystical death, and this dissolution refers to the passing away of the old concept of separate personality. The mortal separate man must die. He must be reborn as the immortal man, one with the Father, before he may exercise his magical powers (Key 13).

Not even death can frighten him, for when he has arrived at this state of consciousness he has made contact with that which is unaffected by any external change whatever. In that contact he finds that even death is an aspect of the activity of the One Self. For the skeleton reaper of Key 13 is, in fact, a representation of the transforming power of that Self, even as the other Keys of the series are representations of other aspects of the same power (Key 13).

The beginning of such discrimination is the mental attitude the Magician typifies-â€”continual endeavor to keep in touch with the power source above the conscious level, combined with habitual alertness. This is the fruit of long practice in concentration, directed steadily to watchful consideration of every detail of self-conscious experience (Key 1).
