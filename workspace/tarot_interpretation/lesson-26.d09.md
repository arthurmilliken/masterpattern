Thus he is able to see how erroneous were many of the suppositions he once mistook for truths (Key 16).

From that time forward he understands that the ephemeral personality is a vehicle for the eternal Self (Key 7).

No part of our personal equipment is separate from the universal Being. Do we see things as they really are? Then we are but sharing the Divine Vision. Our personal command of circumstance is none other than the Universal Dominion, expressed in the conditions of time and space which constitute our personal environment (Key 4).

Yet this suspension of personal activity is accompanied by a tremendous enhancement of real consciousness. The personal vehicle is at rest. The senses are completely quiescent. Yet the Self is wide awake, and there is no cessation of Self-consciousness. He who emerges from the trance of true meditation does not ask "Where am I?" Neither does he make any inquiries as to what he has said or done, for he has never lest consciousness for a moment.

Thus he is able to see how erroneous were many of the suppositions he once mistook for truths (Key 16).
