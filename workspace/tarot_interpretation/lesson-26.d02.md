All transformations of circumstance are for my good. My body and my environment are plastic vehicles for the limitless power and wisdom of Eternal Spirit. They are the out-picturing of my vision of the Self. THE LIFE OF THIS DAY IS A CYCLE OF THE ETERNAL EXISTENCE.

Thus he begins to understand the working of the law of transformation. He learns the futility of the ignorant desire to keep conditions as they are. He sees how the law of eternal progress demands that old forms must give place to new. Thus he comes eventually to discover the mystery of life behind the veil of death, for one certain result of meditation is recovery of definite memories of past incarnations, and once the student has seen for himself that his present life is but one of a series, all fear of death leaves him (Key 13).

From that time forward he understands that the ephemeral personality is a vehicle for the eternal Self (Key 7).

As he continues his practice of recollection and meditation, it becomes increasingly evident to him that the outer conditions of his personal experience have been always the objectifications of his mental attitudes (Key 8).

Furthermore, he discovers that even those mental attitudes which were pain-bearing were beneficent, in that they brought him corrective experience. Then he sees that even his mental unfoldment is a cosmic as well as a personal process. He traces his progress upward from earlier states of comparative ignorance to his present stage of better understanding, and perceives that every step was inevitable. From then on he has no doubt of the perfect completion of the process (Key 10).
