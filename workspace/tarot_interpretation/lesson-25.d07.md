Occult practice, in other words, does not confer magic power, nor enable one to attain it. What it does is to make us aware, through experience and reason, that we have magic power; and then such training is concerned with the orderly exercise of the power we have, to the end that by such exercise we shall see objectively around us a set of circumstances which agrees with our mentally conceived patterns (Key 4).

"My will is to do the will of him that sent me," is an accurate expression of the genuine theurgic state of mind (Key 9).

This understanding is his, not as a consequence of sterile speculation, not as the outcome of mere reasoning, but as the result of a vivid interior perception, which has been described in these pages as hearing the Inner Voice (Key 5).

The lightning-flash of inspiration which awakens us, and at the same time overthrows our prisons of delusion, is always a flash of this self-recollection. When we remember what we really are, we escape from the bondage of the sense of separateness (Key 16).
