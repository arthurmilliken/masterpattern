> Ox or Bull. Oxen are symbols of the taming of natural forces. Thus the letter Aleph is a symbol of creative energy, and of the vital principles of living creatures. This vital principle comes to us in physical form as the radiant energy from the sun. Its association with [Key 0: The Fool](0), Aleph is the special sign for air and breath. The noun "fool" is derived from the Latin follis, meaning "bag of wind."

> Oxen were the motive-power in the early civilizations where the alphabet of occultism was invented. They were used to plow fields, thresh grain, and carry heavy burdens. Agriculture is the basis of civilization, hence the ox represents the power at work in every activity whereby man makes use of the forces surrounding him, and and adapts them to the realization of his purposes. Cultural power and superconsciousness. The Life-Power is the force behind growh and development.

See [Key 0: The Fool](0), [The Eleventh Path](11), [Aleph (letter-name)](111).
