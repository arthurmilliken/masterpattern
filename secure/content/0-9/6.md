### [Tiphareth](1081) (תפארת - 1081)
The Sixth Sephirah

### [The Sixth Path](/keys/ThPARTh)
> *The sixth path (Tiphareth, the sixth Sephirah) is called the [Intelligence of Separative Influence](/keys/ShKL.ShPO.NBDL). It is so called because it gathers together the emanations of the archetypal influence and communicates them to all those blessed ones who are united to its essence.* [Book of Formation]. See [86](86), [450](450), [536](536), [886](886).

### [Key 6: The Lovers](/keys/Z)

- zain: sword or weapon (ז)
- Discrimination
- Disposing Intelligence - [saykel](/keys/ShKL) [ha-regash](/keys/HRGSh) (שכל הרגש) 
- Gemini
- Smell

### [Vav](/keys/V) - ו
Nail or Hook. Vav is used as the conjunction "and". See [12](12), [The Sixteenth Path](16). 

> *The Vav is a vertical line representing a pillar or a man standing upright ... pillars hold Creation together... [Rabbi Ginsburgh, The Alef Beit]*

> *This is the word of Vav: to join us all into a myriad of constellations each remaining different, each bound to the other. [Rabbi Kushner, The Book of Letters]*

### [Gawg](/keys/GG) - גג
> Roof, flat top of a house; the upper part of an alter; width, volume (geometry).

### [Brother GG](/keys/GG) - גג
One of the founders of the Rosicrucian Order.

> This word indicated by the initials G.G., designating the sixth person called by brother C.R. to aid in the founding of the Rosicrucian Order [Fama]. In certain esoteric societies, Yesod is represented by the altar. The top of the the altar is referred to as Tiphareth. see [80](80), [1081](1081).

> Third in order of these second four Brethren is Brother G.G. His initials spell the Hebrew noun **גג**, Gawg, meaning "roof", so suggesting both shelter and secrecy. Thus, the doorkeeper of a Masonic lodge bears the significant name of "tiler", and to "tile" the lodge is to make sure that none are admitted save those having the right to enter. Hence, Brother G.G. represents the human virtue of prudence. He also represents the principle of secrecy, as necessary today as ever before, if genuine occultism is to be propagated successfully.... To give [secrets] to the unprepared is to violate the old alchemical maxim that before one uses the Philosopher's Stone to transmute metals, the metals must first be purified.... Thus, the Fama says Brother C.R. bound the Brethren to be not only faithful and diligent but secret also, and it speaks of the Brethren taking their knowledge into the world in order that it might be examined in secret by the learned. Similarly, in the ministry of Jesus, "Brethren GG" appears side by side with "Brother B". For although Jesus held the multitudes spellbound with his verbal moving pictures, He withheld from all but a tested few the subtler meanings of his brilliant, colorful discourses. *[True and Invisible, p]*

### [Gebeh](/keys/GBA) - גבא
> A reservoir, cistern; from a root meaning "to gather, to collect." Refers to the function of Tiphareth as a reservoir into which flow streams of influence from the Sephiroth above. See [60](60), [600](600), [42](42).
