## The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary

by Karl von Eckartshausen

### Letter VI

> *...The simplicity of our souls is as the shepherds who brought their first offerings, until at last the three principal powers of our royal dignity, our reason, our will, and our activity [The Three Magi] prostrate themselves before Him and offer Him the gifts of truth, wisdom and love.*

> *Little by little the stable of our hearts changes itself into an exterior Temple, where Jesus Christ teaches, but this Temple is still full of Scribes and Pharisees.*

> *Those who sell doves and the money changers are still to be found therein; these must be driven out, and the Temple changed into a House of Prayer.*

> *Little by little Jesus Christ chooses all the good powers in us to announce Him. He heals our blindness, purifies our leprosy, raises the dead powers into living forces within us; He is crucified in us, He dies, and He is gloriously raised again as Conqueror within us. Afterwards His personality lives in us, and instructs us in exalted mysteries, until He has made us complete and ready for the perfect Regeneration--when He mounts to heaven and thence sends us the Spirit of Truth.*

> *But before such a Spirit can act in us we experience certain changes.  The seven powers of our understanding are lifted up within us, but afterwards the seven powers of our heart or of our will, and this exaltation takes place in the following manner. The human understanding is divided into seven powers; the first is that of looking at objects outside ourselves--[intuitus](121). By the second we perceive the objects so regarded--[apperceptio](112). By the third, that which has been perceived is reflected upon--[reflexio](84). The fourth is that of considering these objects in their diversity--[fantasia](65), [imaginatio](90). The fifth is that of deciding upon some thing--[judicium](83). The sixth coordinates all these according to their relationships--[ratio](57). The seventh and last is the power of realising the whole intellectual intuition--[intellectus](126).*

> *This last contains, so to say, the sum of all the others.*

> *The will of man divides itself similarly into seven powers, which, taken together as an unit, form the will of man, being, as it were, its substantial parts.*

> *The first is the capacity of desirign things apart from oneself--[desiderium](99). The second is the power to annex mentally things desired for oneself--[appetitus](115). The third is the power of giving them form, realising them so as to satisfy desire--[concupiscentia](138). The fourth is that of receiving inclinations, without deciding upon acting upon any, as in the condition of passion--[passio](71). The fifth is the capacity for deciding for or against a thing, liberty--[libertas](78). The sixth is that of choice or resolution actually taken--[electio](63). The seventh is the power of givin the object chosen an existence--[voluntas](109). This seventh power also contains all the others in one figure.*

> *Now the seven powers of the understanding, like the seven powers of our heart and will, can be ennobled and exalted in a very special manner, when we embrace Jesus Christ, as being the wisdom of God, for the principle of our reason, and His whole life, which was all love, for motive power fo our will.*

> *Our understanding is formed after that of Jesus Christ: (1) When we have Him in view in everything, so that He becomes the only motive point of all our actions--[intuitus](121); (2) when we perceive His actions, His sentiments and His spirit everywhere--[apperceptio](112); (3) when in all our thoughts we reflect upon His sayings, and think in everything as He would have thought--[reflexio](84); (4) when we so shape our course that His thoughts and His wisdom are the only object for the exercise of our imagination--[fantasia](65); (5) when we reject all thoughts which are not in conformity with His, and choose those only to which He might also confess--[judicium](83); (6) when, in short, we co-ordinate the whole edifice of our ideas and spirit upon the model of his ideas and spirit--[ratio](57); (7) when, as the result of these, there is born in us a new and more brilliant light, surpassing far the light of reason and of the senses--[intellectus](126). our heart is also reformed in like manner, when in everything: (1) We lean on him only--[desiderare](82); (2) we wish for Him only--[appetere](78); (3) we desire only Him--[concupiscere](119); (4) we love Him only--[amare](34); (5) we choose only that which He is, and we avoid all that He is not--[eligere](57); (6) we live only in harmony with Him, after His commandments, institutions and orders--[subordinare](114); whereby (7) there is born a complete union of our will with His, so that we abide in Jesus Chrisg as one sense, one heart; so that the new man is little by little born in us; so that Divine Wisdom and Love unite to form in us the new spiritual man, in whose heargt faith passes into sight, in comparison with which living faith the treasures of India can be considered but as ashes.*

> *This actual possession of God or Jesus Christ in us is the term towards which all the mysteries converge, liek radii to the center of a circle; the highest of religious mysteries is in this consummation....*
