> Strength, severity. Hebrew title of Key 8 and the 5th Sephirah. The resistance necessary for manifestation. All personal notions of will are derived from feelings caused by the resistances to the flow of the Life-force through us. Consciousness of the Greater Adept in Rosicrucian Initiation. see [64](64), [92](92), [211](211), [1200](1200).

> Geburah has three names.

> 1. Pachad, PChD, Fear, and represents the emotion induced in many minds by the presence of individuals in whom the will-force flows powerfully. The same emotion is aroused by law in the hearts of law-breakers.

> 2. Geburah, GBVRH, "Strength," though it is often translated "Severity." Title of Key 8 and the 5th Sephirah. The resistance necessary for manifestation.

> 3. Deen, DIN Justice. This represents the highest aspect of Law and of Volition. It gives us a standard. No unjust regulation is a real law. No unjust volition is true will. Thus he who exercises what he supposes to be "will" in disregard of the rights of others, deludes himself and demonstrates to wiser men that he is actually a slave to his own delusions.

> Part of the doctrines of greater adept are contained in the letters of this word:

> - [Key 2, High Priestess](2), [Gimel](/keys/G): the manifesting power of the one identity is grounded in the life-power's perfect remembrance of all it has ever done. Because that life-power is the central reality of every personal existence, every human being has access to this imperishable and perfect record of the past. This perfect memory of the one identity is the link which unites all personalities, as the characters of a drama are united in the consciousness of its author...

> - [Key 1, The Magician](1), [Beth](/keys/B): Human self-consciousness, seemingly poised between an infinity above and an infinity below, is really an aspect of the one identity. That one sees through our eyes, hears through our ears, speaks though our lips. Appearances of unequal development arise from the law of progressive change in form. Since the life-power at work in and though any given form perfectly knows itself and its powers, it also knows that even an incomplete or unperfected form is not a failure. Man judges by appearances, and judges falsely because he sees only in part. The one identify knows all truth because it is, and therefore knows, the beginning, middle, and end of all creatures.

> - [Key 5, The Hierophant](5), [Vav](/keys/V): The lifepower is ready to impart its higher knowledge to any man. Always it dwells at the center of the temple of human personality. Always it is ready to speak. We have only listen...

> - [Key 19, The Sun](19) [Resh](/keys/R): The one identity is the sun of life and light; the spiritual sun of which our day-star is the external manifestation and symbol he who would know will understand eventually that his personality has no external manifestation and symbol. He who would know will understand eventually that his personality has no existence apart from the shining of the spiritual sun...

> - [Key 4, The Emperor](4) [Heh](/keys/H): The highest manifestation of the spiritual solar energy is the constituting intelligence which makes, frames, and composes everything in the universe. That intelligence is an actual presence in every human personality. Every human personality is a center for the expression of that intelligence. This is the real truth about man. A greater adept is one who fully recognizes this truth." [Paul Case: True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (4th), p.389-393]
