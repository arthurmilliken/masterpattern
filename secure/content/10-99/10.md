> 2x5. 1+2+3+4. In occult arithmetic, 10 and 7 are related. The sum of the numbers 0 to 7 is 28, and the digits of 28 add to 10. Names for the number 10: see [Malkuth](496).

> *The Kingdom of Spirit is imbodied in my Flesh.*

### [The Tenth Path](/keys/MLKVTh) - מלכות
> *The tenth path (the tenth Sephirah, [Malkuth](/keys/MLKVTh)) is called the [Resplendent Intelligence](/keys/ShKL.MThNVTzO). It is so called because it is exalted above every head and sits on the throne of Binah. It illuminates the splendor of all the lights and causes the flowing forth of influence from the Prince of the Countenances.* [The Book of Formation]. [656](656), [1006](1006), [zelator](85), [malkuth](496).

### [Yod](/keys/I) - י
> Hand. Yod is the foundation of the letters and resembles a tongue of flame, symbolizes the flame of spiritual energy which is present in all forms of the life-power's self-expression.

> Yod is a Hebrew noun meaning "the hand of man." Thus it is directly connected with the ancient doctrine: The primary and fundamental Reality of the universe is identical with the power expressed by the handiwork of human beings.

> The upper point of Yod represents the Primal Will, while the rest of the letter corresponds to the aspect of the Life-power named Wisdom. This menas that all mental activity is derived directly from the essential Will of the One Identity, and this mental activity, or volition, takes form as the Wisdom which is the basis for the entire cosmic order. Furthermore, the mental activity of the Primal Will, symbolized by the uppoer point of Yod, expands into the life-force of all beings, and this life-force is fiery. *[Gematria PFC]*

.

> The tenth letter of the Alef-Beit, Yod, is barely larger than a dot and it cannot be divided into component parts. It alludes to God, who is One and Indivisible, for although his attributes seem to be numerous and even contradictory, they flow from a unified purpose and existence *[Rabbi Munk, The Wisdom of the Hebrew Alphabet]*

.

> The Power manifested in the reproductive function, not the function itself. It is [Chaiah](/keys/ChIH), the universal Life-Force. The specific expression of Chiah we control and direct by occult practice is, indeed, that which energizes the repreductive organs from the Mars center. Its control is effected indirectly, by mental activities, which automatically bring about the requried sublimation. The work begins by simple concentration. This established, meditation follows. yod is the channel fo God's will *[Zohar I, p11]*. See [23](23), [90](90), [18](18).

See [The Twentieth Path](20)

### [Heh](/keys/HH) (הה)
The letter-name for Heh. Window. Woe, alas.

> The first Heh represents *insight,* or the Life-power's own knowledge of iteslf. The second Heh is a symbol of *foresight,* directed toward the outcome of necessary consequences following from what insight reveals (see [514](514)). It is written that creation takes place with the letter Heh. Now Heh is the letter of vision, and it is spelled by its own self-duplication, that is, הה. Of these the first is the sign of the waters of Binah, and the second is the sign of the earth of Malkuth. Each is by number half of the paternal Yod, for Heh is 5 and Yod is 10, thus may you see in the first Heh the Sephiroth from Kether to Geburah, and the second, those from Tiphareth to Malkuth. The whole tree is thus expressed by the name of this one letter. The first Heh is insight, the second is the same vision, tuned outward into manifestation. *[The Gematria Notebook of Paul Foster Case, p. 29]*
