> Judge Troward, commenting on Psalm 124 says: *"This Psalm shows that the source of power in the recognition that God is on our side. 'if God be for us, who can be against us?' ([Rom. 8:31, Psalm 118:6, Isaiah 50:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.+8%3A31%2CPs.118%3A6%2CIsa.50%3A8-9&version=KJV)). We get God on our side by putting ourselves on the side of God, 1.8., we work from the principle of interior (divine) power, realizing that this primary action always takes place on the interior plane and assuming. The love and intelligence and impersonality of God, both as our starting point and as the continuous causa causans at every moment. 'Our help is the name of the Lord-how can a name help? 'The name of the Lord is a strong tower: The righteous runneth into it and is safe ([Proverbs 18:10](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm)). The answer is that this name is יהוה."* [[Troward on Psalms, pp. 163-164](http://newthoughtlibrary.com/trowardThomas/psalms/psalms_294.htm)]
