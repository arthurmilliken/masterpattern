### [ehbenyah](/keys/ABNIH) - אבניה
> "The Stones there of (of it)". [Job 28:5,6](http://biblehub.com/job/28-5.htm) *"As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. The stone of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of Gold."* The earth or physical body brings forth the bread of life from the "secret fire". In the passage cited, the phrase translated "stones of it" is אבניה, which broken down is יה אבן, ehban Yah. As יה, is the special divine name attributed to Chokmah, and אבן expresses the union of Chokmah and Tiphareth, the son, אבניה is a symbol of that union. (Chokmah, as the sphere of the fixed stars, is the greater whole that includes the special sphere of the sun, or Tiphareth, in as much as the sun is one of the fixed stars. see [78](78), [536](536).
