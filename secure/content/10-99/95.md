> The valley of vision. [Isaiah 22:1](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-1.htm). see [17](17), [81](81).

95 (5x19)
MADIM Madim. Mars. "powers of vehement strength". see 655, 92,
216, 297, 850.
DNIAL Daniel. A judge from God. Old Testement name, the prophet
and astrologer. Combines the words Dan, DIN with Al, AL, so that
it is a symbol of the expression of the latent powers of Chesed
through the activities of the Geburah (DIN, Justice). Also
Daniel, "The giver of mercies", angle of the 2 of Wands; 50th
Shemhamphorash, "God is Judge", the angle of confession. [Kircher
Oed. eg. V.2 pp. 266-267] 246°-250°. EREGGMO. May 8, July 19,
September 29, December 10, February 20, 4:20-4:40 PM. [Psalm
103:8] "The Lord (IHVH) is full of compassion and graciousness,
slow to anger and plenteous in mercy." To obtain the mercy of
God, and to receive consolation. Rules justice, lawyers, and all
magistrates in general. Gives inspiration to those who are
embarrassed by too many affairs and do not know exactly how to
decide. Persons born: industrious and active in affairs, loves
literature, and distinguishes himself by his eloquence.
Godwin gives: Angel of the 2nd quinance (6°-10°) of Aries; angel
by night of the 2 of Wands. This represents the operation of
Chokmah, sphere of the Zodiac in the archetypal place of ideas
(Atziluth). According to Davidson, the name means "God is my
Judge": an angel of the Order of Principalities, according to
Waite, The Lemegeton. Daviel (as Danjal) is one of a troop of
fallen angels, listed in Enoch I. In the lower regions he
exercise authority over lawyers." [Dictionary of Angels, p. 94]
HMIM ha-mem. the waters. Its refers to the "waters" from which
all organic life is spawned. see 90.
HMN hahman. to be turbulent. Refers to the restless activity
associated with Mars and the 5th Sephirah.
ZBVLN Tribe of Zebulon. "habitation." Cancer. Connected with
alchemical separation-the establishment of the personal purpose,
the formulation of the particular definition. The subtle is
divided from the gross and the distinction between appearance and
essence is clearly marked. In Genesis 49:13: "Zebulun shall dwell
at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships."
This established a clear correspondence the watery sign of Cancer
(Key 7) and the 4th House (associated with the home as a
"haven") [In the 4th house astrologers seek for indications as to
the end of a matter-for indications of what cargo we may expect
when our ship comes in]. Compare Domus, (64). Also Deuteronomy
33:19: "For they will suck the abundance of the seas and the
hidden treasure of the sand (see 45, 90). Compare with the
symbolism of Key 7, in which the idea of habitation is strong, by
the reason of the walled city in the background. [Links up also
with habit, pattern, ritual by virtue of Cancer being ruled by
the Moon or sub-consciousness] see Key 2, 64, 418, 867, 319, 100,
30, 570, 501, 54, 162, 830, 395, 259, 7, 331, 466.
MHLK mahalak. way, journey, walk, distance, free access. This
idea is also suggested by the chariot in the foreground of Key 7.
Furthermore, it is implied in the general meaning Zebulun, for a
haven for ships is at the end of a voyage or journey.
MLKH Malkah. the bride, a queen. One of the titles of Malkuth.
The alchemical queen is connected with whiteness, analogous to
Silver and the Moon. She is the bride of the king in Tiphareth,
the heart center and sun-power. see 55, 496, 148.
"Yet is Malkuth also KLH (Kallah) the Bride, and MLKH (Malkah)
the Queen... Yet more, Malkah is written with the letters of
HMLK, the King, and the King is Tiphareth, yet is Tiphareth
ThPARTh or 1081, and the seed of this is 10 which is both Malkuth
and Yod. Extended downward, Tiphareth is completed in Malkuth,
even as Tiphareth itself is the King or Royal Son, one with his
Father, and that Father is AB in Chokmah which also is the body
of Yod. Again, MLKH (Malkah) is 95 and this is the number of the
name of the letter Peh spelt in plenitude PH-HH...Thus is Malkah
truly as a Queen, also the Queen's daughter all glorious within.
Now she holdeth the mystery of union, and thus is she known to
the Sons of the Doctrine of ABNGDLH the "Great Stone," that is by
interpretation the perfect union in Chesed or Gedulah of the
Father AB with the Son BN." [26th Communication]
HMLK ha-Melek. The king. i.e. Tiphareth. see 90, 1081.
MNH monah. to appoint, ordain or number.
SLH selah. A word occurring often in the Psalm, the meaning of
which is obscure. It indicates the end of a thought. a musical
term (in Psalms); for ever. Mathers, in [Sepher Sephiroth, p. 15]
cites [Psalm 32:4,5] "for night and day your hand was heavy upon
me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah. Then
I acknowledge my sin to you and did not cover un my iniquity. I
said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord -and you
forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah."
PH HH Peh. Letter name Peh spelt in full. The mouth of the
eternal and said to be the secret of the covenant with spiritual
Israel. see 85, 463.
"95... this is the number of the name of the letter Peh spelt in
plenitude PH-HH, so that in the first of these four letters you
may see the mouth of the Eternal, and in the other three Hehs
three-fold vision of past and present and of time to come, for
are they not three Hehs? Yet see further. Their whole addition
is 15, and this is IH, Jah, the Holy name of Chokmah and HVD
(Hod), the Splendor of the Presence.
Comment: One of the most important points in this section is the
Gematria of PH-HH. What the text does not say, though well known
to Qabalists, is that P. is the letter of Mars. So that PH, HH
must express a total Martian activity. Indeed all four letters
of this full spelling of Peh are related to Mars." [26th
Communication]
ABN GDHL ehben-gedul. The great stone. Refers to the perfect
union in Chesed or Gedulah of the Father (AB), and son (BN).
HHOIH Hahaiah. 12th Shemhamphorash; angel of 10 of Pentacles.
(Dieu Refuge). 56°-60° ATARPH. March 31, June 11, August 22,
November 2, January 13. Psalm: "Ut quid domine recessiti longe,
despicis in opportunitatibus, intribulatione). Rules dreams, and
reveals mysteries hidden from mortals. Influences persons wise,
spiritual and discrete. Persons born: sweet-tempered, amicable
physiognomy, agreeable manners. Godwin gives: Hihyah; angle of
sixth quinance (26°-30°) of Virgo; angel by night of the 10 of
Pentacles. This represents the influence of the sphere of the
elements in the physical plane of action. Davidson says he is an
angel of the Order of Cherubim, and that his corresponding angel
is ATARPH.
