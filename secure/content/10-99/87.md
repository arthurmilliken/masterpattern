### [lebanah](/keys/LBNH) - לבנה
> Pale or white one, Moon; The Sphere of the Moon. Lebanah, as white or pale one, identifies the part of the work associated with Yesod with the alchemical "White work of the Moon," wherein is concealed the real secret of building the mystic temple of regenerated humanity. Formed of **לב** (laib) heart, **בן** (ben) son, and **נה** (nah) beauty, ornament. All these words are related to Tiphareth, of which Yesod is a direct reflection. The powers of the automatic consciousness of Yesod are the reproductions of the powers of the Ego in Tiphareth. See [80](80), [220](220), [32](32), [175](175). *[Gematria PFC]*
