> Day, light of day, time, season. [[Genesis 1:5](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm)] gives Yom as God's own name for light, the Qabalistic symbol of the Manifest (see [69](69)), as contrasted with the darkenss, to which the name Night is give, as representing the Unmanifest. With different vowel points, [Yoom](/keys/IVM) - to be warm or bright. *[Gematria PFC]*

> Gaskell suggests that days are "symbolic of periods of manifestation -- cycles of involution and evolution. The six days of Genesis are all periods of involution, not evolution... The light is the consciousness, the spirit-side of being, whilst the darkness is the material, the form-side of nature. Evening and morning are symbolic of the indrawing and the outgoing forces, constituting the first Life-wave." *[Dictionary of all Scriptures and Myths, p202]*
