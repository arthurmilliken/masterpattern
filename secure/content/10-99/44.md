## 44 - Forty-Four
> (4x11)

> > *"The sum of the 9 sides, 14 corners and 21 boundary lines of the vault of the adepts. Combined value of Mercury ([37](37)) and sulphur ([7](7)).*

> > *"Perimeter of a circle with a diameter of [14](14). Circumference of the Creative World, Briah.*

> > *"44 is the number of the holy metals or pentacles (pantacles) of the planets, which are as follows: [7](7) each to Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and Sun ([28](28) in all), five each to Venus and Mercury ([10](10) in all) and [6](6) to Luna. Note that this distribution represents 44 as being composed of the addition of the three triangular numbers [28](28), [10](10), and [6](6), or the extension of [7](7), [4](4), and [3](3). Here we have a hint because the basic digits [3](3), [4](4), and [7](7) from which these number are derived multiply together to make 84, and add together to make [14](14), and which the great pyramid is reckoned as having a height of 14, its sloping edges have combined length of [84](84) (approximately, in whole numbers).*

> > *"As 4 times 11, refers mystically to the time, times and half a time mentioned in the apocalypse. By reference to the notes of the number 11, it will be seen that 11 years are the circumference of a diameter of 42 months. Therefore in this connection, 44 would represent 4 times 11 Egyptian years, or 4 times 3960 days = 15,840 days = 528 months of 30 days each."*

### [dam](/keys/DM) - 
> blood. Formed from the word Adam [ADM]. The physical organism of Man is condensed from Blood. see 5, 55, 45. The Location of the temple of the Wise men was at Dam-Car, in Arabia. Dam-Car means: Blood of the Lamb. It is the initiate's own body. The practices of initiation modify blood chemistry. Arabia (sterility) refers to the necessary celibacy which gives the strength for initiation. see 470, 68.

> Fabre D'Olivet comments: "DM. The roots which, by means of any sign whatever, arise from the roots AB or AM, symbols of active or passive principles, are all very difficult to determine and to grasp, on account of the extent of meaning which they present, and the contrary ideas which they produce. These particularly demand close attention. It is, at first glance, universalized sympathy; that is to say, a homogeneous thing formed by affinity of similar parts, and holding to the universal organization of being.

> DM is a broader sense, it is that which is identical; in a more restricted sense, it is blood, assimilative bond between soul and body, according to the profound though of Moses... It is that which assimilates, which becomes homogeneous; mingles with another thing: thence the general idea of that which is no longer distinguishable, which ceases to be different; that which renounces its seity, its individuality, is identified with the whole, is calm, quiet, silent, asleep.

> That Arabic [word] has developed in the ancient language the same general idea; but in the modern idiom this root has received acceptations somewhat different. [The Arabic word] expresses in general a glutinous, sticky fluid. In particular, as noun, it is blood; as verb; it is the action of covering with a glutinous glaze. From the later meaning results, in the analogue [word], that of contaminating, calumniating, covering with blame." [Hebrew Tongue Restored p. 323-324]

> Sendovigius asserts: "Thou hast in thy body the anatomy of the whole world, and all thy members answer to some celestials; let, therefore, the searcher of the sacred science know that the soul in man, the lesser world or microcosm, substituting the place of its center, is the king, and is placed in the vital spirit in the purest blood [DM]. That governs the mind, and the mind the body..." [New Light of Alchemy, p. 42] Also: Blood, the first of the 10 plagues of Egypt. Exodus 7:19: "the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron," take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt-over the streams and canals, over the ponds and the reservoirs," and they will turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden buckets and stone jars."

Aquarius is the distinctive sign of man, and manhood = virilitas = KCh (strength, power, #28)" [Note, p. 430] Mark 14:13 "And he sends two of this disciples, and says to them, go into the city, and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him.
