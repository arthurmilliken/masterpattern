### [Pitdah](/keys/PThDH) - 
> Emerald, according to Kosminsky; the second stone of the breastplate of the high priest, in [Exodus 28:17] "And you shall set it in settings of stones, four rows of stones; the first row shall be a red [Hematite], an emeralds, and a marble." For the other stones, see 45, 702, 150, 345, 395, 370, 308, 84, 1210, 350, 85.

> Isidore Kosminsky writes: "The second stone of the breastplate is give as Pitdah, variously interpreted as a Topaz, peridot, yellowish-green serpentine, diamond and chrysolite. The Targums agree that a green stone is implied and some authorities seek to clear the mystery by advancing that the stone was of a yellowish-green. The Topaz of the ancients is not the Topaz of today, but is identified with the stone known to us as the chrysolite or Peridot. Traditionally the emerald is associated with the second sign of the Zodiac... The gem needed is therefor a green one, and this is traditionally the correct one for the Sionshor or Taurus in which Nogah or Venus delights and in which Labanah or the Moon exalts. The Emerald was sacred to the period this period of the year. This gem was well-known amongst ancient nations, especially those of Egypt and Ethiopia where the chief Emerald mines were... The tribe Simeon corresponding to the zodiacal Gemini was engraved on the second gem of the breastplate--although it has no connection with it... it should be understood that by Emerald is meant the precious Emeralds as we know it or its varieties Beryl and Aquamarine. It may be noted that the Topaz, a gem most generally favored as the second stone on the breastplate, is traditionally assigned to the opposite sing of the zodiac, Scorpio..." [The Magic and Science of Jewels and Stones, pp. 22-24]

> He continues: "The Emerald is the beautiful green variety of the Beryl family, colored by Chromium... the whole beryl family is classified under the sign Taurus. their crystalline form is hexagonal (6-sided), and six is the traditional number of Venus, whose earth house or mansion in astrology is the heavenly Taurus... As eye stones the stones of Beryl family have always been held in high esteem, Pope John XXI affirming that a disease eye treated with an emerald became sound again. It was not claimed that the emerald would restore lost sight, but it was regarded as extremely potent in eye disease, injury or trouble of any kind. Sometimes it was sufficient, especially in the case of inflamed eyes, to bathe the eye in water in which emeralds had been steeped for 6 hours; at other times the stone was reduced to the finest powder, an extremely small quantity of which was placed in the eye at state intervals... The tradition that when a serpent fixed its eyes on an emerald it becomes blind is echoed from the Hebrew philosophy, and Ahmed Ben Abdaliziz in his 'Treatise on Jewels' has it that the lustre of Emeralds makes serpents blind... The symbolist will at once perceive the hidden parable: in astrology, serpents have been classed under the Scorpion of the Zodiac, and the Venusian Taurus in the zodiac is opposite to the Scorpion... it can easily be seen why the Emerald is the emblem of true happiness and the preserver of chastity, and why it was said to fracture if chastity were violated: To one taking vows of chastity and breaking them, the Emerald could never appear the same again-before his spiritual vision it would be broken and shattered. Leonarus says that the Emerald protected women in childbirth, and must old writers are impressive in warning men to wear one as a charm against spiritual and mental weakness... as an emblem of eternal spring, Iarchus advised that it an emerald set in a ring of gold be placed on the solar finger of the left hand when the sun entered Taurus, the wearer would attain his cherished aim and be enabled by the sweating of the stone to detect poisons.. the Romans greatly esteemed the Emerald as an eye stone and a natural specific for ophthalmia, holding that what healed an calmed the spiritual eye would heal and calm the natural eye. The Persians applied ashes of burnt Emeralds to ulcers with curative effect. They said that the Emerald brought mental tranquillity, cured unnatural thirst, stomach troubles, jaundice, liver troubles, obstructions, gravel, stricture, bodily pains and epilepsy. Alberus Magnus also recommends it as a cure for epileptic attacks. Mystics have always regarded that Emerald worth. It is spoken of by Cardanus as an ideal gem for divinatory purposes-no doubt because of its pure spiritual import. Aristotles writes that an Emerald hung from the neck or worn on the finger protects from the 'falling sickness'. The ancient writers held that all kinds of divination were helped by the Emerald, and when worn by the transaction of honest business it gave favor to the wearer... Paracelsus wrote that the Emerald was in sympathy with the metal copper-also recognized as the chief metal of Venus. [The Magic and Science of Jewels and Stones, pp. 139-140]
