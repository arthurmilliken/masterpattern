## 88 - Eighty-Eight
> (8x11)

###/keys/ChKLL hakallah
> colored. The word "color" is derived from a Latin
root, meaning "to conceal." This suggests that the material
world is a veil of color, concealing the real nature of the Life-
Power. Also redness, sparkling.

###/keys/ChMM chammam
> to be hot; to glow, to brood, to hatch. This word
is closely related to the old name of Egypt, Khem (ChM), whence,
by an interesting series of linguistic transmutations, we get our
modern word chemistry--so that the name of that branch of science
which is doing so much to establish the real unity of the
material world is, literally, "The Wisdom of Egypt." see 78.

###/keys/ChSK chasak
> to spare, withhold, be without.

###/keys/NChL nachal
> something hollowed out, a valley. The popular idea
is that the material world is a vale of tears; but there is a
profounder meaning than this. The Fool (Aleph), always descends
into a new valley on his adventurous Journey to the next mountain
peak. see 108, 7, 21, 14, 44, 66, 28. With different vowel
points: to take possession, possess, to inherent, to get,
acquire.

###/keys/LBVN Loben
> loben. whiteness, semen. Refers to purity and
innocence (see 82).

###/keys/MGDIAL Magdiel
> A duke of Edom, associated (with Mibzar) with
Yesod. [Genesis 36:43]: "El is renown" (in man). "Magdiel and
Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their
settlements in the land they occupied." Edom is a representation
of unbalanced force.

###/keys/ChLN Helon
> "strong" The father of Eliab of Zebolon [Numbers
1:9, 2:7]. Refers to alchemical separation. see 95

###/keys/CHNIK chawnaek
> trained person; apprentice; pupil. This word
really means initiated. [Genesis 14:14] "And when Abram heard
that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants,
born into his own house, and pursued them unto Dan." Dan =
Scorpio = alchemical putrefaction. see Key 13, 318, 94.

###/keys/ChP chaph
> "pure"; innocent. In Job 33:9: "I am pure and without
sin; I am clean and free from guilt. (10) yet God has found fault
with me; he considers me his enemy." see 808.

Fabre D'Olivet comments: ChP Heph. Every idea of protective
covering given to a thing; a guarantee, a surety. The Arabic
[word] is an onomatopoetic and idiomatic root which depicts that
which acts upon the surface, which skims lightly over a thing.
The verb [Arabic word] characterizes the condition of that which
becomes light; [Arabic word] anything which shivers, shudders
with fear, trembles with fright, etc." [The Hebrew Tongue
Restored p. 353]

###/keys/PCh pach
> danger; net; snare, trap. Psalm 119:110: "The wicked
have set a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your
precepts." According to Fabre D'Olivet: "PCh Pheh: everything
which is drawn in, expanded, as the breath; all that which is
unfolded in order. To envelop and seize, as a net... The Arabic
[word] constitutes all onomatopoetic and idiomatic root which
describes every kind of hissing of the voice, snoring, strong
respiration, rattling. When this voice is strengthened in [Arabic
word] , it signifies literally, an ambush; a trap." [The Hebrew
Tongue Restored, p. 425]

## Greek/Latin

### Nike, Vikeh (Gr)
> Victory. The deduction of 88 to its least
number is 7, the Sephirah named Netzach (Victory). see 360, 744
(Greek).

### Aqua Vita (Lt)
> Water of Life. "If you would make our substance
red, you must first make it white. Its three natures are summed
up in whiteness and redness. Take, therefore, our Saturn, subject
it to coction in Aqua Vitae until it turns white, becomes thick,
and is coagulated, and then again till it becomes red. Then it is
red lead, and without this lead of the sages nothing can be
effected."

### Filius Dei (Lt)
> Son of God. The water of life is the mystical son of
God and that son (the rider in the chariot in Key 7) is also the
rose itself (see 154, 119).

### victoria (Lt)
> victory. see 224, 360.

### Invenies (Lt)
> You shall find. Part of an alchemical phrase in
Secret Symbols (Page 17). "Visit the interior of the earth by
rectifying you shall find the hidden stone." see 570 Latin.

### trigono (Lt)
> triangle. The triangle of Fire, which symbolizes
spiritual energy or Aleph. see 134, 46 (Latin)

### Nascimur (Lt)
> We are born. You shall find that the son of God is
born anew through us by the aid of the triangle of Fire and the
water of Life. Part of the phrase discovered in the vault of
brother CR, see 683 Latin.

> great; greatest. Part of a phrase referring to
God. see 234.
