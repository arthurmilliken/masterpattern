Fabre D'Olivet writes: "AN. an onomatopoeic root which depicts
the agonies of the soul; pain, sorrow, anhelation.

The Arabic [word] used as verb, signifies to sigh, to complain.
AVN Every idea of pain, sorrow, trouble, calamity.

AN The signs which compose the root, are those of power and of
individual existence. They determine together the seity,
sameness, selfsameness, or the me of the being, and limit the
exitent of its circumscription.

AN. In a brother sense, it is the sphere of moral activity; in a
restricted sense, it is the body of the being. One says in
Hebrew, [ANI] I; as if one said my sameness, that which
constitutes the sum of my faculties, my circumscription. [Hebrew

continually perishing, yet it is while we are incarnate that it
is that which is the means to all wealth and power. It is the
basis of all effort, yet if it be separated from the directing
spirit it is nothingness and vanity. It is the cause of all our
terrors, when we misuse it or misinterpret it. (see 259, 389,
186).

> species, kind; "sort" in [Psalm 144:13] "Our barns will

by the thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields.

Fabre D'Olivet writes on the root: "ZN. The demonstrative sign
united to the root AN, symbol of the moral or physical
circumscription of the being, constitutes a root which develops
two distinct meanings according as they are considered as mind or
matter. From the view point of mind, it is a moral manifestation
which makes the faculties of the being understood and determines
the kind, for that of matter, it is a physical manifestation
which delivers the body and abandons it to pleasure. Thence:
ZN Every classification by sort and by kind according to the
faculties: every pleasure of the body for its nourishment:
figuratively, all lewdness, fornication, debauchery: a
prostitute, a place of prostitution, etc.

The Arabic [word] empresses a sort of suspension of opinion in
things of divers natures. As an onomatopoetic root [Arabic word],
describes a murmuring.

ZVN action of being nourished, feeding the body; or
metaphorically the action of enjoying, making abuse, prostituting
one s self." [Hebrew Tongue Restored p. 343] see 707
