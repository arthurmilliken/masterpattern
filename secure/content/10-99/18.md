ChThA chattaw. to miss the target; to sin. Fabre D'Olivet
comments: The root "ChTh. The sign of effort united to that of
resistance, constitutes a root whence come all ideas of frustrated
hope; of failure, sin, error. The arabic [word] signifies
properly to cut in small morsels; and **** to pose, depose; place,
replace: to lower, humble, reduce, etc. ChTh or ChThTh (intens.)
That which misses the mark, which is at fault, which sins in any
manner whatsoever. ChVTh (comp.) The root ThCh, symbol of effort
united to resistance, being considered from another viewpoint,
furnishes the restricted idea of spinning, and n consequence,
every kind of thread, and of sewing; so that from the sense of
sewing, comes that of mending; metaphorically, that of amendment,
restoration: whence it results that the word ChThA, which
signifies a sin, signifies also an expiation." [The Hebrew Tongue
Restored, p. 349]
