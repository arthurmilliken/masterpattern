### [Guph](/keys/GVP) - גוף
> The physical body, person, substance, essence, one of the 4 elements (matter as opposed to spirit). The lowest, and most external aspect of personality. Assigned to Malkuth, the fruit of completion of the Tree of Life. Gimel in **גוף** stands for the Uniting Intelligence joining Yekhidah to the Ego seated in the hearts of men, and also directly related to the Life-force in Chokmah. Vav stands for the Ego as the inner teacher. The burden of his teaching is that true wisdom must ever find expression in loving-kindness. Peh stands for the destruction of error and represents Yesod (by numeration) and the powers of the automatic consciousness. It is during man's life in the physical body that he must accomplish the work which overcomes the delusions which seem to limit him. Guph is the starting point for the work which leads to liberation and is also the place where the Great Work finds completion. The Hebrew dictionary gives the additional meaning of "one of the four elements; matter, as the opposite of spirit, person (grammatical)." see [496](496), [19](19), [463](463), [400](400), [430](430), [543](543), [1006](1006), [55](55), [564](564), [170](170), [231](231), [809](809).
