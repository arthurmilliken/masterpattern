O Ayin. "The letter Ayin does not speak. It only sees. It is an
eye, OIN. Close your eyes. Open your mouth. Now try to see. That
is the sound of Ayin." [The Book of Letters, Rabbi Kushner] "The
name of the letters OIN when rearranged, spells "Poor" ONI. The
letter Ayin comes after Samekh in the alphabet, to teach us that
a man should "support" (S) the "poor" (O) before poverty causes
them to fall. In its shape also, the letter Ayin, with its one
curved leg, suggest a person who has no firm basis; it is bending
and unstable." [Letter of Fire, Rabbi Glazerson]
"This path (26th, connecting Tiphareth to Hod) is connected with
the letter Ayin, and the name of this letter, besides signifying
the eye as an organ of sight , also means the visible part of
an object, the surface, the appearance. Thus the word Ayin
stands for the phenomenal as opposed to the noumenal, for that
which is given to sensation or impression as opposed to that
which is subject to natural verification. The eye is therefore
the natural symbol of those external shows which conceals
reality. It is the sign of man s finite experience of things as
they seem, as opposed to the realities of the hidden essence
veiled, in form. Through the function of the eye we become aware
of the phantasmagoria of the phenomenal world, which Shakespeare
called this unsubstantial pageant. The untrained eye is the
great deceiver. On this account the letter Ayin is attributed to
the Tarot Key whose title means The Slanderer. [Paul Case: True
and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (4th), p. 340].
In scripture this is the number of years of the ordinary span of
human life, in contrast to the magical age of 120 years,
mentioned by the Psalmist. (In Key 15 the evil represents the
dweller on the threshold, barring the way that leads to the inner
center. Thus he is the same in function as Daleth, the door which
must be opened and passed before we can enter the palace of the
king.) [Paul Case: True and Invisible (4th), p. 182]
The Chaldean character looks nothing like an eye, but its form
suggest the duality of human visions, the letter-name more
definitely. [Paul Case: Tarot Practice Course] see 358
