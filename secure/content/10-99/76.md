### [Corona Dei]
> Crown of the Lord. Rosenroth in [K.D.L.C.K. p.86] says it is the name of God which Rabbi Moses says refers to Malkuth and that is this, says Rabbi Ishmael, which is blessed and the fount of blessings. For Rosenroth it also refers to Briah, as signifying all forms and manifestations which are born [i.e. imaged] from the crown of the Lord.
