## 12 - Twelve
> 3x2x2. 12: reversal, suspended mind.  The power of 2 manifested through the agency of 1. The outpouring of the powers of subconsciousness (2) through the fixation of self-consciousness in acts of attention (1). This is attained by practices which quiet the mind and suspend the formation of chains of ideas.

> 12 = 3 x 4. 7 = 3 + 4. Key 12 is a symbol of the multiplication of the power of the Emperor by the generative potency of the Empress.

> 12: zodiacal signs; 7: planets known to the ancient astronomers. 12 is associated with the idea of completeness, because 12 months and 12 signs of the zodiac round out a year.

### [The Twelfth Path](/keys/B)
> The twelfth path (Beth, joining Kether to Binah) is called the Intelligence of Transparency because it is the image of that phase of Gedulah (literally, "of that wheeling of Gedulah") which is the source of vision in those who behold apparitions. *[The Book of Formation]*

Conferred by knowledge of the 12th path:

> *"Beth - He is above all afflictions and all fears."* [Eliphas Levi, Transcendental Magic]

> *"I am the Transparent Intelligence, penetrating all veils of ignorance with the light of life eternal."* [Meditations on the Paths of Wisdom]

> The adjective Transparency or Light ([Bahir](/keys/BHIR)) [בהיר] means clear, bright, transparent, lucid. Light in Hebrew is [אור], [Aur](/keys/AVR). This light is universally diffused. The Hebrew account of creation says light manifested prior to the formation of luminaries, suggesting that the self-conscious attentive power of Beth is necessary to concentrate these units of diffised power into a central focus. Note that [Bahir](/keys/BHIR), בהיר has the same numerical value of word אויר, [Fiery](/keys/AVIR).

### [Letter-name Vav](/keys/VV) - וו
> nail, hook, pin. Something to support something else which hangs from it. Corresponding to [Key 5, The Hierophant](5). The [16th path](16) of Vav "veils the name of Him, the fortunate one" (הוא). Thus the Hierophant may be considered to be a symbol for the cosmic self, Yekhidah acting as the inner teacher of mankind. Vav represents also the Heart, seat of interior hearing or the ego in Tiphareth, suggesting that the seed the 6th Sephira is preexistent in Kether, the First. see [53](53), [177](177), [158](158), [508](508), [32](32), [168](168), [331](331), [506](506), [415](415), [6](6).

### [azad](/keys/AZD) - אזד
> confirmed, concluded (Aramaic). In [Daniel 2:5](http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-5.htm) and [Daniel 2:8](http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-8.htm) the aramaic אזדא, [AZDA](/keys/AZDA), is used: the A.V. translation, "is gone," the Jewish translation, "is certain." Also "He departed, he went forth." Chaldean perhaps adj. "settled, firm, or decided." [C.F. The Talmud AZDA LThOMIH "decided to his purpose" (Daniel 2). The root perhaps akin to ShVTh IMD "to set", hence different from AVL, which most prefer since D=L, as ROD=ROL, and so they render AVDA MNI MLThA  "the word (i.e. decree) is gone forth (i.e. has been issued) from me."] From protestant Hebrew Dictionary.

### [khad](/keys/ChD) - חד
> sharp. Fabre D'Olivet: *"The power of division, expressed by the root אד which, arrested by the effort which results from its contraction with the elementary sign Cheth, becomes the image of relative unity. It is literally, a sharp thing, a point, a summit. The Arabic [word] presents in general, the ideas of terminating, determining, circumscribing, limiting. it is, in a more restricted sense, to grind; metaphorically, to punish. This root being reinforced in the verb [xxx], expresses the action of breaking through and excavating ground. As a noun it signifies literally the check. The point of anything whatever. Everything which pricks, everything which is extreme, initial: metaphorically, a drop of wine; gaiety, lively and piquant."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p. 347]

And this is that mystical thing, which is written [Daniel 7:5](http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm): "And behold another beast, a second like unto a bear, stood on its one side, and it had three ribs standing out in his mouth, between his teeth; and thus they said to it 'arise, eat much flesh.'" The meaning is, that in order to constitute the metallic kingdom, in the second place, iron is to be taken; in whose mouth or opening (which comes to pass in an earthen vessel) a threefold scoria is thrust out, from within its whitish nature."* see [318](318), [229](229).
