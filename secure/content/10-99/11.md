### [The Eleventh Path](/keys/A)
> The eleventh path (Aleph, joining Kether to Chokmah) is called the Scintillating or Fiery Intelligence. It is the essence of the veil placed before the dispositions and order of the superior and inferior causes. He who possesses this path is in the enjoyment of great dignity for he stands face to face with the Cause of Causes. *[The Book of Formation]*

Conferred by knowledge of the 11th Path:

> *"Aleph - He beholds God face to face, without dying, and converses familiarly with the seven genii who command the entire celestial army.* [Eliphas Levi, Transcendental Magic]

> *"I am the Scintillating Intelligence, veiling with the fire of Spirit, the causes superior from the causes inferior."* [Meditations on the 32 Paths of Wisdom].
