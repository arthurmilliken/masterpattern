KLCh "He is firm", or "pining with desire". This name was borne

derived from a word like KLH Calah, "adorned", crowned , a
bride , equivalent to the virgin , or Ishtar; if so, we may
compare it to [Greek word], Kalee, beautiful ." Genesis 10:11
"out of that Land [Shinar] went forth Asshur, and built Ninevah,
and the City Rehoboth, and Calah." [Ancient Faiths, p. 382] But
Fabre D'Olivet suggest that Calah means the growing wise, old
men ruling within": "The word KLCh, which signifies literally, an
ancient, an old man, that is to say, a man whom age and
experience have led to perfection. Thence by extension, the idea
of a senate, of an assembly of old men, of a wise and
conservative institution." [Hebrew Tongue Restored p. 284] see

###/keys/NCh noah
> rest, cessation. pleasing, kind. Ark builder. marks a

This name appears in [Genesis 5:29] "And he called his name Noah,
saying He shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our
hands: because of the ground which the Lord hath cursed"

1. Fabre D'Olivet renders this verse: "And he called his name
Noah (repose of elementary nature), saying, this shall rest us
(our existence) and lighten our labor, and the physical obstacles
of our hands, because of the Adamic element which IHVH has
?called?." He comments: "NH. Noah... or Noe. as it has been
vulgarly written following the orthography of the Hellenist
translators. The root from which this important name comes, is
composed of the sign of produced being Nun, image of reflected
existence, and the sign of the effort of nature Cheth, which
gives birth to vital equilbrium, to existence. this root offers
the idea of that perfect repose, which, for a thing long agitated
in opposed directions, results in that state of equilibrium where
it dwells immobile.

Nearly all the tongues of the orient understands this mysterious
expression. The Hebrew and the Chaldaic draw from it two verbs.
By the first NHVH, one understands, to lead to the end, to guide
toward the place of repose; by the second, NVA, to repose, to
rest tranquil, to be in a state of peace, of calm, of perfect
bliss. It is from the latter, tht the name of the cosmogonic
personage who saw the end of the world and its renewal, is
derived. It is the emblem of the repose of elementary existence,
the sleep of nature." [Hebrew Tongue Restored p. pp. 167-168]

2. The Zohar [I:58A-B] comments: "And he called his name Noah
saying, this shall comfort us etc. How did Noah s father know
this? In this way, when God cursed the earth, Adam said to him,
sovereign of the Universe, how long shall the earth be subject to
this curse? God replied: Until a descendant of yours shall be
born ???, like yourself. So that waited until at last a child
was born circumcised and marked with the holy sign. When his
father saw this, and observed the Shekinah hovering over him, he
called him Noah [literally rest], in anticipation of his future
career. For up to his time men did not know the proper way to sow
or reap or plough, and they used to work the ground with their
hands. But when Noah came, he taught the arts of husbandry, and
devised for them the necessary implements. Hence it is written:
The one shall comfort us for our work and for the toil of our
hands. It was indeed Noah who liberated the earth from its
curse; for up to his time they used to sow wheat and reap thorns
and thistles; here Noah is called "A man of the ground." [AISh
HADMH = 366] (Genesis 9:20). Rabbi Judah said "The word AISh
(Man-311) is applied to him because he was righteous, and through
the sacrifice which he brought, he liberated the earth from its
curse ... When Noah was born, the gave him a name which connoted
???, in the hope that it would work out its own fulfillment for
them. His relation to God, however, is expressed by the same
letters in the reverse order, viz. ChN (favor), as it is written,
??? Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord ; whereas the
anagram of the name offer the (wicked) son of Judah is RO ra
(evil), and of him it is written And er was evil in the sight of
the Lord [Genesis 38:17]. When Noah grew up, he saw how mankind
were sinning before God, he withdrew himself form their society
and sought to serve is master, so as not to be led astray by
them. He was especially diligent in the study of the Book of Adam
and the Book of Enoch... and from them he learnt the proper forms
in which to worship God. This explains how he knew it was
incumbent upon him to bring an offering; it was these book which
revealed to him the basis on which the existence of the world
depends, to wit, the sacrifices, without which neither the higher
nor the lower world can endure." (pp. 187-189)

3. Gaskell suggest that Noah is "A symbol of the individuality,
or the manifested self in evolution-the permanent center of
evolution in the soul. It is the Buddhi-manasic principle, or the
incarnation of the self as applying to the three lower planes...
The Noah principle... is perfection of the soul according to
its sage of development. The knowledge it possessed is derived
from within (walked with God)." [Dictionary of all Scriptures and
Myths, p. 538]

4. A. Jokej writes: "Noah is the divinely appointed figure, in
whom the whole cause of regeneration is set forth, every secret
of this great mystery being here drawn for us as God alone could
draw it.. Noah, then, is the spiritual mind, for he is only the
continuation of Seth s line, and figures the form of life which
the spiritual mind takes as this stage in its development, when
it has come so far as to know the judgement of the old creation,
and the way through that Judgement to a cleansed and better
world." [Types of Genesis, pp. 104-105] Rosenroth, in [K.D.L.C.K.
p. 69] says this word is equivalent in number to AVN. [quote ends
