> Seeing the only Wise and Merciful God in these latter days hath poured out so richly his mercy and goodness to Mankind, whereby we do attain more and more to the perfect knowledge of his Son Jesus Christ and [Nature](/english?word=Nature), that justly we may boast of the happy time, wherein there

([p.2](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/2))

> there is not only discovered unto us the half part of the World, which was heretofore unknown & hidden, but he hath also made manifest unto us many wonderful, and never-heretofore seen, Works and Creatures of [Nature](/english?word=Nature), and moreover hath raised men, indued with great Wisdom, which might partly renew and reduce all Arts (in this our Age spotted and imperfect) to perfection; so that finally Man might thereby understand his own Nobleness and Worth, and why he is called [Microcosmus](/latin?word=Microcosmus), and how far his knowledge extendeth in Nature.

> Although the rude World herewith will be but little pleased, but rather smile and scoff thereat; also the Pride and Covetousness of the Learned is so great, it will not suffer them to agree together; but were they united, they might out of all those things which in this our Age God doth so richly bestow upon us, collect [Librum Naturae](/latin?word=Librum+Naturae), or a perfect Method of all Arts: but such is their opposition, that they still keep, and are loth to leave the old course, esteeming [Porphiry](/english?word=Porphiry), [Aristotle](/english?word=Aristotle), and [Galen](/english?word=Galen), yea and that which

([p.3](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/3))

> which hath but a meer shew of learning, more then the clear and manifested Light and Truth; who if they were now living, with much joy would leave their erroneous Doctrines. But here is too great weaknesses for such a great Work: And although in [Theologie](/english?word=Theologie), [Physic](/english?word=Physic), and the [Mathematic](/english?word=Mathematic), the Truth doth oppose it self; nevertheless the old Enemy by his subtilty and craft doth shew himself in hindering every good purpose by his Instruments and contentious wavering people. To such an intent of a general Reformation, the most godly and highly illuminated Father, our Brother, [C.R.](/english?word=C.R.) a German, the chief and original of our Fraternity, hath much and long time laboured, who by reason of his poverty (although descended of Noble Parents) in the fifth year of his age was placed in a Cloyster, where he had learned indifferently the [Greek](/english?word=Greek) and [Latin](/english?word=Latin) Tongues, who (upon his earnest desire and request) being yet in his growing years, was associated to a Brother, [P.A.L.](/english?word=P.A.L.) who had determined to go to the Holy Land.

> Although this Brother dyed in [Ciprus](/english?word=Ciprus), and

([p.4](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/4))

> and so never came to [Jerusalem](/english?word=Jerusalem), yet our Brother [C. R.](/english?word=C.R.) did not return, but shipped himself over, and went to [Damasco](/english?word=Damasco), minding from thence to go to [Jerusalem](/english?word=Jerusalem); but by reason of the feebleness of his body he remained still there, and by his skill in Physick he obtained much favour with the [Turks](/english?word=Turks): In the mean time he became by chance acquainted with the Wise men of [Damasco](/english?word=Damasco) in [Arabia](/english?word=Arabia), and beheld what great Wonders they wrought, and how [Nature](/english?word=Nature) was discovered unto them; hereby was that high and noble Spirit of Brother [C. R.](/english?word=C.R.) so stired up, that [Jerusalem](/english?word=Jerusalem) was not so much now in his mind as [Damasco](/english?word=Damasco); also he could not bridle his desires any longer, but made a bargain with the [Arabians](/english?word=Arabians), that they should carry him for a certain sum of money to [Damasco](/english?word=Damasco); he was but of the age of sixteen years when he came thither, yet of a strong Dutch constitution; there the Wise received him (as he himself witnessseth) not as a stranger, but as one whom they had long expected, they called him by his name, and shewed him other secrets out of his Cloyster, whereat he could not but mightily wonder


([p.5](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/5))


> wonder: He learned there better the [Arabian](/english?word=Arabian) Tongue; so that the year following he translated the Book [M.](/english?word=M.) into good [Latin](/english?word=Latin), which he afterwards brought with him. This is the place where he did learn his Physick, and his Mathematicks, whereof the World hath just cause to rejoyce, if there were more Love, and less Envy. After three years he returned again with good consent, shipped himself over [Sinus Arabicus](/latin?word=Sinus+Arabicus) into [Egypt](/english?word=Egypt), where he remained not long, but only took better notice there of the Plants and Creatures; he sailed over the whole [Mediterranean](/english?word=Mediterranean) Sea for to come unto [Fez](/english?word=Fez), where the [Arabians](/english?word=Arabians) had directed him. And it is a great shame unto us, that wise men, so far remote th’one from th’other, should not only be of one opinion, hating all contentious Writings, but also be so willing and ready under the seal of secrecy to impart their secrets to others.

> Every year the [Arabians](/english?word=Arabians) and [Affricans](/english?word=Affricans) do send one to another, inquiring one of another out of their Arts, if happily they had found out some better things, or if Experience had weakened their Rea-sons

([p.6](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/6))

> sons. Yearly there came something to light, whereby the [Mathematica](/english?word=Mathematica), [Physic](/english?word=Physic) and [Magic](/english?word=Magic) (for in those are they of [Fez](/english?word=Fez) most skilful) were amended; as there is now adays in [Germany](/english?word=Germany) no want of learned Men, [Magicians](/english?word=Magicians), [Cabalists](/english?word=Cabalists), [Physicians](/english?word=Physicians), and [Philosphers](/english?word=Philosphers), were there but more love and kindness among them, or that the most part of them would not keep their secrets close only to themselves. At [Fez](/english?word=Fez) he did get acquaintance with those which are commonly called the Elementary Inhabitants, who revealed unto him many of their secrets: As we [Germans](/english?word=Germans) likewise might gather together many things, if there were the like unity, and desire of searching out of secrets amongst us.

> Of these of [Fez](/english?word=Fez) he often did confess, that their [Magia](/english?word=Magia) was not altogether pure, and also that their [Cabala](/english?word=Cabala) was defiled with their Religion; but notwithstanding he knew how to make good use of the same, and found still more better grounds of his Faith, altogether agreeable with the Harmony of the whole World, and wonderfully impressed in all Periods of times, and thence proceedeth that fair Con-

([p.7](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/7))

> Concord, that as in every several kernel is contained a whole good tree or fruit, so likewise is included in the little body of Man the whole great World, whose Religion, policy, health, members, nature, language, words and works, are agreeing, sympathizing, and in equal tune and melody with God, Heaven and Earth; and that which is disagreeing with them, is error, falsehood and of the Devil, who alone is the first, middle, and last cause of strife, blindness, and darkness in the World: Also, might one examine all and several persons upon the Earth, he should find that which is good and right, is always agreeing with it self; but all the rest is spotted with a thousand erroneous conceits.

> After two years Brother [C. R.](/english?word=C.R.) departed the City [Fez](/english?word=Fez), and sailed with many costly things into [Spain](/english?word=Spain), hoping well, he himself had so well and so profitably spent his time in his travel, that the learned in [Europe](/english?word=Europe) would highly rejoyce with him, and begin to rule, and order all their Studies, according to those sound and sure Foundations. He therefore con-ferred

([p.8](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/8))

> ferred with the Learned in [Spain](/english?word=Spain), shewing unto them the Errors of our Arts, and how they might be corrected, and from whence they should gather the true [Inditia](/latin?word=Inditia) of the Times to come, and wherein they ought to agree with those things that are past; also how the faults of the Church and the whole [Philosopia Moralis](/latin?word=Philosopia+Moralis) was to be amended: He shewed them new Growths, new Fruits, and Beasts, which did concord with old [Philosophy](/english?word=Philosophy), and prescribed them new [Axiomata](/latin?word=Axiomata), whereby all things might fully be restored: But it was to them a laughing matter; and being a new thing unto them, they feared that their great Name should be lessened, if they should now again begin to learn and acknowledg their many years Errors, to which they were accustomed, and wherewith they had gained them enough: Who so loveth unquietness, let him be reformed.

> The same Song was also sang to him by other Nations, the which moved him the more (because it happened to him contrary to his expectation,) being then ready bountifully to impart all his Arts and Secrets to the Learned, if they would

([p.9](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/9))

> have but undertaken to write the true and infallible [Axiomata](/english?word=Axiomata), out of all Faculties, Sciences and Arts, and whole [Nature](/english?word=Nature), as that which he knew would direct them, like a Globe, or Circle, to the onely middle Point, and [Centrum](/english?word=Centrum), and (as it is usual among the [Arabians](/english?word=Arabians)) it should onely serve to the wise and learned for a Rule, that also there might be a Society in [Europe](/english?word=Europe), which might have Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, sufficient for to bestow them on Kings, for their necessary uses, and lawful purposes: with which such as be Governors might be brought up, for to learn all that which God hath suffered Man to know, and thereby to be enabled in all times of need to give their counsel unto those that seek it, like the Heathen Oracles: Verily we must confess that the world in those days was already big with those great Commotions, laboring to be delivered of them; and did bring forth painful, worthy men, who brake with all force through Darkness and Barbarism, and left us who succeeded to follow them: and assuredly they have been the upper-most

([p.10](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/10))

> most point in [Trygono igneo](/latin?word=Trygono+igneo), whose flame now should be more and more brighter, and shall undoubtedly give to the World the last Light.

> Such a one likewise hath [Theophrastus](/english?word=Theophrastus) been in Vocation and Callings, although he was none of our Fraternity, yet nevertheless hath he diligently read over the Book [M](/english?word=M): whereby his sharp [ingenium](/latin?word=ingenium) was exalted; but this man was also hindered in his course by the multitude of the learned and wise-seeming men, that he was never able peaceably to confer with others of his Knowledg and Understanding he had of [Nature](/english?word=Nature). And therefore in his writing he rather mocked these busie bodies, and doth not shew them altogether what he was: yet nevertheless there is found with him well grounded the aforenamed [Harmonia](/latin?word=Harmonia), which without doubt he had imparted to the Learned, if he had not found them rather worthy of subtil vexation, then to be instructed in greater Arts and Sciences; he then with a free and careless life lost his time, and left unto the World their foolish pleasures.

> But

([p.11](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/11))

> But that we do not forget our loving Father, Brother [C. R.](/english?word=C.R.) he after many painful Travels, and his fruitless true Instructions, returned again into [Germany](/english?word=Germany), the which he (by reason of the alterations which were shortly to come, and of the strange and dangerous contentions) heartily loved: There, although he could have bragged with his Art, but specially of the transmutations of Metals; yet did he esteem more Heaven, and the Citizens thereof, Man, then all vain glory and pomp.

> Nevertheless he builded a fitting and neat inhabitation, in the which he ruminated his Voyage, and Philosophy, and reduced them together in a true Memorial. In this house he spent a great time in the [Mathematicks](/english?word=Mathematicks), and made many fine Instruments, [ex omnibus hujus artis partibus](/english?word=ex+omnibus+hujus+artis+partibus), whereof there is but little remaining to us, as hereafter you shall understand. After five years came again into his mind the wished for Reformation; and in regard he doubted of the ayd and help of others, although he himself was painful, lusty, and unwearisom, he undertook, with

([p.12](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/12))

> with some few adjoyned with him, to attempt the same: wherefore he desired to that end, to have out of his first Cloyster (to the which he bare a great affection) three of his Brethren, Brother [G. V.](/english?word=G.V.) Brother [I. A.](/english?word=I.A.) and Brother [I. O.](/english?word=I.O.) who besides that, they had some more knowledg in the Arts, then at that time many others had, he did binde those three unto himself, to be faithful, diligent, and secret; as also to commit carefully to writing, all that which he should direct and instruct them in, to the end that those which were to come, and through especial Revelation should be received into this Fraternity, might not be deceived of the least sillable and word.

> After this manner began the Fraternity of the [Rosie Cross](/english?word=Rosie+Cross); first, by four persons onely, and by them was made the Magical Language and writing, with a large Dictionary, which we yet dayly use to Gods praise and glory, and do finde great wisdom therein; they made also the first part of the Book [M](/english?word=M): but in respect that the labor was too heavy, and the unspeakable concourse of the sick hin-

([p.13](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/13))

> hindred them, and also whilst his new building (called [Sancti spiritus](/latin?word=Sancti+spiritus)) was now finished, they concluded to draw and receive yet others more into their Fraternity; to this end was chosen brother[R. C.](/english?word=R.C.) his deceased fathers brothers son, brother [B.](/english?word=B.) a skilful Painter, [G.](/english?word=G.) and [P. D.](/english?word=P.D.) their Secretary, all [Germains](/english?word=Germains) except [I. A.](/english?word=I.A.) so in all they were eight in number, all batchelors and of vowed virginity, by those was collected a book or volumn of all that which man can desire, wish, or hope for.

> Although we do now freely confess, that the World is much amended within an hundred years, yet we are assured, that our [Axiomata](/latin?word=Axiomata) shall unmovably remain unto the Worlds End, and also the world in her highest and last Age shall not attain to see any thing else; for our [Rota](/latin?word=Rota) takes her beginning from that day when God spake [Fiat](/latin?word=Fiat), and shall end when he shall speak [Pereat](/latin?word=Pereat); yet Gods Clock striketh every minute, where ours scarce striketh perfect hours. We also stedfastly beleeve, that if our Brethren and Fathers had lived in this our present and clear

([p.14](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/14))

> clear light, they would more roughly have handled the Pope, [Mahomet](/english?word=Mahomet), Scribes, Artists, and Sophisters, and had shewed themselves more helpful, not simply with sighs, and wishing of their end and consummation.

> When now these eight Brethren had disposed and ordered all things in such manner, as there was not now need of any great labour, and also that every one was sufficiently instructed, and able perfectly to discourse of secret and manifest Philosophy, they would not remain any longer together, but as in the beginning they had agreed, they separated themselves into several Countries, because that not only their [Axiomata](/latin?word=Axiomata) might in secret be more profoundly examined by the learned, but that they themselves, if in some Country or other they observed anything, or perceived some Error, they might inform one another of it.

> Their agreement was this: First, That none of them should profess any other thing, then to cure the sick, and that [gratis](/latin?word=gratis). 2. None of the Posterity should be constrained to wear one certain kind of habit

([p.15](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/15))

> habit, but therein to follow the custom of the Country. 3. That every year upon the day [C.](/english?word=C.) they should meet together at the house [S. Spiritus](/latin?word=S.Spiritus), or to write the cause of his absence. 4. Every Brother should look out for a worthy person, who after his discease might succeed him. 5. The word [C. R.](/english?word=C.R.) should be their Seal, Mark, and Character. 6. The Fraternity should remain secret one hundred years. These six Articles they bound themselves one to another to keep; and five of the Brethren departed, only the Brethren [B.](/english?word=B.) and [D.](/english?word=D.) remained with the Father [Fra: R. C.](/latin?word=Fra+R.C.) a whole year; when these likewise departed, then remained by him his Cousen and Brother [I. O.](/english?word=I.O.) so that he hath all the days of his life with him two of his Brethren. And although that as yet the Church was not cleansed, nevertheless we know that they did think of her, and with what longing desire they looked for: Every year they assembled together with joy, and made a full resolution of that which they had done; there must certainly have been great pleasure, to hear truly and without invention related and

([p.16](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/16))

> and rehearsed all the Wonders which God hath poured out here and there through the World. Every one may hold it out for certain, that such persons as were sent, and joined together by God, and the Heavens, and chosen out of the wisest of men, as have lived in many Ages, did live together above all others in highest Unity, greatest Secrecy, and most kindness one towards another.

> After such a most laudable sort they did spend their lives; and although they were free from all diseases and pain, yet notwithstanding they could not live and pass their time appointed of God. The first of this Fraternity which dyed, and that in [England](/english?word=England), was [I. O.](/english?word=I.O.) as Brother [C.](/english?word=C.) long before had foretold him; he was very expert, and well learned in [Cabala](/english?word=Cabala), as his Book called [H.](/english?word=H.) witnesseth: In England he is much spoken of, and chiefly because he cured a young Earl of [Norfolk](/english?word=Norfolk) of the Leprosie. They had concluded, that as much as possibly could be their burial place should be kept secret, as at this day it is not known unto us what is become of some of them, yet every ones

([p.17](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/17))

> ones place was supplyed with a fit successor; but this we wil confesse publickly by these presents to the honour of God, That what secret soever we have learned out of the book [M.](/english?word=M) (although before our eyes we behold the image and [pattern](/english?word=pattern) of all the world) yet are there not shewn unto us our misfortunes, nor hour of death, the which only is known to God himself, who thereby would have us keep in a continual readiness; but hereof more in our Confession, where we do set down 37 Reasons wherefore we now do make known our Fraternity, and proffer such high Mysteries freely, and without constraint and reward: also we do promise more gold then both the Indies bring to the King of [Spain](/english?word=Spain); for [Europe](/english?word=Europe) is with child and will bring forth a strong child, who shall stand in need of a great godfathers gift.

> After the death of [I. O.](/english?word=I.O.) Brother[R. C.](/english?word=R.C.) rested not, but as soon as he could, called the rest together, (and as we suppose) then his grave was made; although hitherto we (who were the latest) did not know

([p.18](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/18))

> know when our loving father [R. C.](/english?word=R.C.) died, and had no more but the bare names of the beginners, and all their successors to us; yet there came into our memory, a secret, which through dark and hidden words, and speeches of the [100](100) years, brother [A.](/english?word=A.) the successor of [D.](/english?word=D.) (who was of the last and second row and succession), and had lived amongst many of us,) did impart unto us of the third row and succession; otherwise we must confess, that after the death of the said A. none of us had in any manner known anything of Brother R.C. and of his first fellow-brethren, then that which was extant of them in our Philosophical [Bibliotheca](/latin?word=Bibliotheca), amongst which our [Axiomata](/latin?word=Axiomata) was held for the chiefest [Rota Mundi](/latin?word=Rota+Mundi), for the most artificial, and [Protheus](/english?word=Protheus) the most profitable. Likewise we do not certainly know if these of the second row have been of the like wisdom as the first, and if they were admitted to all things. It shall be declared hereafter to the gentle Reader, not onely what we have heard of the burial of [R. C.](/english?word=R.C.) but also made manifest publickly by the foresight, sufferance and com-

([p.19](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/19))

> commandement of God, whom we most faithfully obey, that if we shall be answered discreetly and Christian-like, we will not be afraid to set forth publickly in Print, our names, and sirnames, our meetings, or any thing else that may be required at our hands.

> Now the true and fundamental relation of the finding out of the high illuminated man of God, [Fra. C. R.  C.](/latin?word=Fra.C.R.C.) is this; After that [A.](/english?word=A.) in [Gallia Narbonensi](/latin?word=Gallia+Narbonensi) was deceased, then suceeded in his place, our loving Brother [N. N.](/english?word=N.N.) this man after he had repaired unto us to take the solemn oath of fidelity and scerecy, he informed us [bona fide](/latin?word=bona+fide), That [A.](/english?word=A.) had comforted him in telling him, that this Fraternity should ere long not remain so hidden, but should be to all the whole [German](/english?word=German) Nation helpful, needful, and commendable; of the which he was not in any wise in his estate ashamed of. The year following after he had performed his School right, and was minded now to travel, being for that purpose sufficiently provided with [Fortunatus](/latin?word=Fortunatus) purse, he thought (he being a good [Architect](/english?word=Architect)) to alter something of his building, and

([p.20](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/20))

> and to make it more fit: in such renewing he lighted upon the memorial Table which was cast of brasse, and containeth all the names of the brethren, with some few other things; this he would transfer in another more fitting vault: for where or when [Fra: R. C.](/latin?word=Fra:R.C.) died, or in what country he was buried, was by our predecessors concealed and unknown unto us. In this Table stuck a great naile somewhat strong, so that when he was with force drawn out, he took with him an indifferent big stone out of the thin wall, or plaistering of the hidden door, and so unlooked for uncovered the door; wherefore we did with joy and longing throw down the rest of the wall, and cleared the door, upon which that was written in great letters, [Post 120 annos patebo](/latin?word=Post+120+annos+patebo), with the year of the Lord under it: therefore we gave God thanks and let it rest that same night, because first we would overlook our [Rotam](/latin?word=Rotam); but we refer our selves again to the confession, for what we here publish is done for the help of those that are worthy, but to the unworthy (God willing) it will be small profit: For like as our door

([p.21](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/21))

> door was after so many years wonderfully discovered, also there shall be opened a door to [Europe](/english?word=Europe) (when the wall is removed) which already doth begin to appear, and with great desire is expected of many.

> In the morning following we opened the door, and there appeared to our sight a Vault of seven sides and corners, every side five foot broad, and the height of eight foot; Although the Sun never shined in this Vault, nevertheless it was enlightened with another sun, which had learned this from the Sun, and was situated in the upper part in the Center of the sieling; in the midst, in stead of a Tomb-stone, was a round Altar covered over with a plate of brass, and thereon this engraven:

> [A.C. R.C. Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulchrum feci.](/latin?word=A.C.R.C.+Hoc+universi+compendium+unius+mihi+sepulchrum+feci.)

> Round about the first Circle or Brim stood,

> [Iesus mihi omnia](/latin?word=Iesus+mihi+omnia)

> In the middle were four figures, inclosed in circles, whose circumscription was, 1. Ne-

([p.22](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/22))

>   1. [Nequaquam Vacuum](/latin?word=Nequaquam+Vacuum)
>   2. [Legis Iugum](/latin?word=Legis+Iugum)
>   3. [Libertas Evangelij](/latin?word=Libertas+Evangelij)
>   4. [Dei gloria intacta](/latin?word=Dei+gloria+intacta)

> This is all clear and bright, as also the seventh side and the two [Heptagoni](/latin?word=Heptagoni): so we kneeled altogether down, and gave thanks to the sole wise, sole mighty, and sole eternal God, who hath taught us more then all mens wit could have found out, praised be his holy name. This Vault we parted in three parts, the upper part or sieling, the wall or side, the ground or floor.

> Of the upper part you shall understand no more of it at this time, but that it was divided according to the seven sides in the triangle, which was in the bright center; but what therein is contained, you shall God willing (that are desirous of our society) behold the same with your own eys; but every side or wall is parted into ten squares, every one with their several figures and sentences, as they are truly shewed, and set forth [Concentratum](/latin?word=Concentratum) here in our book.

> The bottom again is parted in the triangle, but because therein is discribed the power and

([p.23](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/23))

> and rule of the inferior Governors, we leave to manifest the same, for fear of the abuse by the evil and ungodly world. But those that are provided and stored with the heavenly Antidote, they do without fear or hurt, tread on, and bruise the head of the old and evil serpent, which this our age is well fitted for: every side or wall had a door for a chest, wherein there lay diverse things, especially all our books, which otherwise we had, besides the [Vocabular](/latin?word=Vocabular) of [Theoph: Par. Ho.](/english?word=Theoph+Par.Ho.) and these which daily unfalsifieth we do participate. Herein also we found his [Itinerarium](/latin?word=Itinerarium), and [vitam](/latin?word=vitam), whence this relation for the most part is taken. In another chest were looking-glasses of divers virtues, as also in other places were little bells, burning lamps, & chiefly wonderful artificial Songs; generally all done to that end, that if it should happen after many hundred years, the Order or Fraternity should come to nothing, they might by this onely Vault be restored again.

> Now as yet we had not seen the dead body of our careful and wise father, we therfore removed the Altar aside, there we lifted

> lifted up a strong plate of brass, and found a fair and worthy body, whole and unconsumed, as the same is here lively counterfeited, with all the Ornaments and Attires; in his hand he held a parchment book, called I. the which next to the Bible, is our greatest treasure, which ought to be delivered to the censure of the world. At the end of this book standeth this following [Elogium](/latin?word=Elogium).

> [Granum pectori Iesu insitum](/latin?word=Granum+pectori+Iesu+insitum).

> C. Ros. C. ex nobili atque splendida Germaniae R.C. familia oriundus, vir sui seculi divinis revelationibus subtilissimis imaginationibus, indefessis laboribus ad coelestia, atque humana mysteria; arcanave admissus postquam suam (quam Arabico, & Africano itineribus Collegerat) plusquam regiam, atque imperatoriam Gazam suo seculo nondum convenientem, posteritati eruendam custo divisset et jam suarum Artium, ut et nominis, fides acconjunctissimos herides instituisset, mundum minutum omnibus motibus magno illi respondentem fabricasset hocque tandem preteritarum, praesentium, et futurarum, rerum compendio extracto, centena-rio

In [Politia](/english?word=Politia) we acknowledge the [Roman](/english?word=Roman) Empire and [Quartam Monarchiam](/latin?word=Quartam+Monarchiam) for our Christian head; albeit we know what alterations be at hand, and would fain impart the same with all our hearts, to other godly learned men; notwithstanding our hand-writing which is in our hands, no man (except God alone) can make it common, nor any unworthy person is able to bereave us of it. But we shall help with secret aid this so good a cause, as God shal permit or hinder us: For our God is not blinde, as the Heathens [Fortuna](/latin?word=Fortuna), but is the Churches Ornament, and the honor of the Temple.

And as he is the true Image of the Father, so is she his Image; It shall not be said, this is true according to [Philosophy](/english?word=Philosophy), but true according to [Theologie](/english?word=Theologie); And wherein [Plato](/english?word=Plato), [Aristotle](/english?word=Aristotle), [Pythagoras](/english?word=Pythagoras) and others did hit the mark, and wherein [Enoch](/english?word=Enoch), [Abraham](/english?word=Abraham), Moses, [Solomon](/english?word=Solomon) did excel; but especially wherewith that wonderful book the [Bible](/english?word=Bible) agreeth.

So according to the wil and meaning of [Fra: C. R.

So we know certainly, that the time shal likewise come, that that which we yet keep in secret, we shal openly, freely, and with a loud voice publish and confess it before al the world; the which [Gentle Reader](/english?word=Gentle+Reader) wish with us with all thy heart, that it may happen with speed.
