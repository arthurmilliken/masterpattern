## Genesis 15 (KJV)

**God's Covenant with Abram**
([Romans 4:1-12](https://biblehub.com/kjv/romans/4.htm); [Galatians 3:1-9](https://biblehub.com/kjv/galatians/3.htm); [Hebrews 11:8-19](https://biblehub.com/kjv/hebrews/11.htm#8); [James 2:14-26](https://biblehub.com/kjv/james/2.htm#14))

([1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-1.htm)) [After](/keys/AChR) | these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

([2](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-2.htm)) And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? ([3](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-3.htm)) And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. ([4](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-4.htm)) And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. ([5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-5.htm)) And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. ([6](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-6.htm)) And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. ([7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-7.htm)) And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this [land](/keys/ATh-HARTz) to inherit it.

**God Confirms His Promise**
([Numbers 34:1-15](https://biblehub.com/kjv/numbers/34.htm); [Romans 4:13-25](https://biblehub.com/kjv/romans/4.htm#13))

([8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-8.htm)) And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? ([9](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-9.htm)) And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. ([10](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-10.htm)) And he took unto him [all these](/keys/ATh-KL-ALH), and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: [but the birds](/keys/VATh-HTzPR) divided he not. ([11](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-11.htm)) And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

([12](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-12.htm)) And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. ([13](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-13.htm)) And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be [{as} a stranger](/keys/KI-GR) | in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; ([14](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-14.htm)) And also [that nation](/keys/ATh-HGVI), whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. ([15](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-15.htm)) And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. ([16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-16.htm)) But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

([17](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-17.htm)) And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

([18](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-18.htm)) In the same day the LORD made a covenant [with Abram](/keys/ATh-ABRM), saying, Unto thy seed have I given this [land](/keys/ATh-HARTz), from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

([19](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-19.htm)) [The Kenites](/keys/ATh-HQINI), [and the Kenizzites](/keys/VATh-HQNZI), and [the Kadmonites](/keys/HQDMNI), ([20](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-20.htm)) [And the Hittites](/keys/VATh-HChThI), [and the Perizzites](/keys/VATh-HPRZI), [and the Rephaims](/keys/VATh-HRPAIM), ([21](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-21.htm)) [And the Amorites](/keys/VATh-HAMRI), [and the Canaanites](/keys/VATh-HKNONI), [and the Girgashites](/keys/VATh-HGRGShI), [and the Jebusites](/keys/VATh-HIBVSI).

**The War of the Kings**

([1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-1.htm)) And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; ([2](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-2.htm)) That these made war with [Bera](/keys/ATh-BRO) king of Sodom, [and with Birsha](/keys/VATh-BRShO) king of Gomorrah, [Shinab](/keys/ShNAB) | king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. ([3](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-3.htm)) All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. ([4](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-4.htm)) Twelve years they served [Chedorlaomer](/keys/ATh-KDRLOMR), and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. ([5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-5.htm)) And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote [the Rephaims](/keys/ATh-RPAIM) in Ashteroth Karnaim, [and the Zuzims](/keys/VATh-HZVZIM) in Ham, and [the Emims](/keys/HAIMIM) in Shaveh Kiriathaim, ([6](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-6.htm)) [And the Horites](/keys/VATh-HChRI) in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness. ([7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-7.htm)) And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote [all the country](/keys/ATh-KL-ShDH) of the Amalekites, and also [the Amorites](/keys/ATh-HAMRI), that dwelt in Hazezontamar. ([8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-8.htm)) And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; ([9](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-9.htm)) With [Chedorlaomer](/keys/KDRLOMR) the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings [with five](/keys/ATh-HChMShH).

**Lot Seized by the Four Kings**

([10](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-10.htm)) And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. ([11](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-11.htm)) And they took [all the goods](/keys/ATh-KL-RKSh) of Sodom and Gomorrah, [and all their victuals](/keys/VATh-KL-AKLM), and went their way. ([12](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-12.htm)) And they took [Lot](/keys/ATh-LVT), Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, [and his goods](/keys/VATh-RKShV), and departed.

**Abram Rescues Lot**

([13](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-13.htm)) And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. ([14](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-14.htm)) And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed [his trained servants](/keys/ATh-ChNIKIV), born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan. ([15](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-15.htm)) And he divided himself [against them](/keys/OLIHM), | he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. ([16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-16.htm)) And he brought back [all the goods](/keys/KL-HRKSh), and also brought again his brother [Lot](/keys/ATh-LVT), and his goods, and [the women](/keys/HNShIM) also, [and the people](/keys/VATh-HOM).

**Melchizedek Blesses Abram ([Hebrews 7:1-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+7%3A1-10&version=KJV))**

([17](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-17.htm)) And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of [Chedorlaomer](/keys/ATh-KDRLOMR), [and of the kings](/keys/VATh-HMLKIM) that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. ([18](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-18.htm)) And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.

([19](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-19.htm)) And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

([20](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-20.htm)) And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

([21](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-21.htm)) And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. ([22](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-22.htm)) And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, ([23](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-23.htm)) That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made [Abram](/keys/ATh-ABRM) rich: ([24](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/14-24.htm)) Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
