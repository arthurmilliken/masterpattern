## Genesis 15 (KJV)

**God's Covenant with Abram** ([Romans 4:1-12](https://biblehub.com/kjv/romans/4.htm); [Galatians 3:1-9](https://biblehub.com/kjv/galatians/3.htm); [Hebrews 11:8-19](https://biblehub.com/kjv/hebrews/11.htm#8); [James 2:14-26](https://biblehub.com/kjv/james/2.htm#14))

([1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-1.htm)) [After](/keys/AChR) | these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

([2](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-2.htm)) And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? ([3](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-3.htm)) And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. ([4](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-4.htm)) And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. ([5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-5.htm)) And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. ([6](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-6.htm)) And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. ([7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-7.htm)) And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this [land](/keys/ATh-HARTz) to inherit it.

**God Confirms His Promise** ([Numbers 34:1-15](https://biblehub.com/kjv/numbers/34.htm); [Romans 4:13-25](https://biblehub.com/kjv/romans/4.htm#13))

([8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-8.htm)) And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? ([9](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-9.htm)) And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. ([10](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-10.htm)) And he took unto him [all these](/keys/ATh-KL-ALH), and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: [but the birds](/keys/VATh-HTzPR) divided he not. ([11](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-11.htm)) And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.

([12](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-12.htm)) And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. ([13](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-13.htm)) [And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety](/keys/VIAMR.LABRM.IDO.ThDO.KI-GR) that thy seed shall be [a stranger](/keys/KI-GR) | in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; ([14](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-14.htm)) And also [that nation](/keys/ATh-HGVI), whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. ([15](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-15.htm)) And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. ([16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-16.htm)) But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

([17](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-17.htm)) And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.

([18](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-18.htm)) In the same day the LORD made a covenant [with Abram](/keys/ATh-ABRM), saying, Unto thy seed have I given this [land](/keys/ATh-HARTz), from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

([19](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-19.htm)) [The Kenites](/keys/ATh-HQINI), [and the Kenizzites](/keys/VATh-HQNZI), and [the Kadmonites](/keys/HQDMNI), ([20](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-20.htm)) [And the Hittites](/keys/VATh-HChThI), [and the Perizzites](/keys/VATh-HPRZI), [and the Rephaims](/keys/VATh-HRPAIM), ([21](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/15-21.htm)) [And the Amorites](/keys/VATh-HAMRI), [and the Canaanites](/keys/VATh-HKNONI), [and the Girgashites](/keys/VATh-HGRGShI), [and the Jebusites](/keys/VATh-HIBVSI).
