## Genesis 2 (KJV)

**The Seventh Day: God Rests** ([Exodus 16:22-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+16%3A22-36&version=KJV); [Hebrews 4:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews+4%3A1-11&version=KJV))

([1](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-1.htm)) Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. ([2](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-2.htm)) And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. ([3](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-3.htm)) And God blessed [the seventh](/keys/ATh-IVM.HShBIOI) [day](/keys/ATh-IVM), and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

**The Creation of Man**

([4](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-4.htm)) These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, ([5](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-5.htm)) [And every](/keys/VKL) plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till [the ground](/keys/ATh.HADMH). ([6](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-6.htm)) But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered [the whole face of the ground](/keys/ATh-KL-PNI-HADMH). ([7](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-7.htm)) And the LORD God formed [man](/keys/ATh-HADM) of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

**The Planting of the Garden**

([8](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-8.htm)) And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put [the man](/ATh-HADM) whom he had formed. ([9](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-9.htm)) And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

([10](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-10.htm)) And a river went out of Eden to water [the garden](/keys/ATh-HGN); and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. ([11](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-11.htm)) The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth [the whole land](/keys/KL-ARTz) of Havilah, where there is gold; ([12](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-12.htm)) And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. ([13](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-13.htm)) And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth [the whole land](/keys/KL-ARTz) of Ethiopia. ([14](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-14.htm)) And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

**The Forbidden Fruit**

([15](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-15.htm)) And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. ([16](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-16.htm)) And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: ([17](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-17.htm)) But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

**Adam Names the Animals**

([18](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-18.htm)) And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. ([19](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-19.htm)) And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and [every fowl](/keys/KL-OVP) of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. ([20](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-20.htm)) And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.

**The Creation of Woman**

([21](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-21.htm)) And [the LORD God](/keys/IHVH.ALHIM) [caused](/keys/VIPL.IHVH.ALHIM) a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; ([22](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-22.htm)) And [the rib](/keys/ATh-HTzLO), which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

([23](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-23.htm)) And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

([24](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-24.htm)) Therefore shall a man leave [his father](/keys/ATh-ABIV) [and his mother](/keys/VATh-AMV), and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. ([25](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-25.htm)) And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
