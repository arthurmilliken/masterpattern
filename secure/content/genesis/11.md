## Genesis 11 (KJV)

**The Tower of Babel** ([Daniel 1:1-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+1%3A1-7&version=KJV))

([1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-1.htm)) And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. ([2](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-2.htm)) And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. ([3](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-3.htm)) And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. ([4](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-4.htm)) And they said, [Go to](/keys/HBH), let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. ([5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-5.htm)) And the LORD came down to see [the city](/keys/ATh-HOIR) [and the tower](/keys/VATh-HMGDL), which the children of men builded. ([6](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-6.htm)) And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. ([7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-7.htm)) Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. ([8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-8.htm)) So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. ([9](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-9.htm)) Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

**Terah's Descendants**

([27](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-27.htm)) Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat [Abram](/keys/ATh-ABRM), [Nahor](/keys/ATh-NChVR), [and Haran](/keys/VATh-HRN); and Haran begat [Lot](/keys/ATh-LVT). ([28](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-28.htm)) And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. ([29](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-29.htm)) And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. ([30](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-30.htm)) But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

([31](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-31.htm)) And Terah took [Abram](/keys/ATh-ABRM) his son, [and Lot](/keys/VATh-LVT) the son of Haran his son's son, [and Sarai](/keys/VATh-ShRI) his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. ([32](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/11-32.htm)) And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
