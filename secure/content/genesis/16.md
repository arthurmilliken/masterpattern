## Chapter 16 (ASV)

**Sarah, Hagar and Ishmael**

([1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-1.htm)) Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. ([2](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-2.htm)) And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. ([3](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-3.htm)) And Sarai, Abram's wife, took [Hagar](/keys/ATh-HGR) the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife. ([4](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-4.htm)) And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. ([5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-5.htm)) And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee. ([6](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-6.htm)) But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.

([7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-7.htm)) And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. ([8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-8.htm)) And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai. ([9](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-9.htm)) And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. ([10](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-10.htm)) And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply [thy seed](/keys/ATh-ZROK), that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

([11](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-11.htm)) And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction.

([12](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-12.htm)) And he shall be as a wild ass among men; his hand'shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren.

([13](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-13.htm)) And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me? ([14](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-14.htm)) Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.

([15](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-15.htm)) And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael. ([16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/16-16.htm)) And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare [Ishmael](/keys/ATh-IShMOAL) to Abram.
