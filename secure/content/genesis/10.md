## Genesis 10 (KJV)

**The Japhethites** ([1 Chronicles 1:5-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+chronicles+1%3A5-7&version=KJV))

([1](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-1.htm)) Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

([2](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-2.htm)) The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. ([3](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-3.htm)) And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. ([4](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-4.htm)) And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. ([5](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-5.htm)) By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

**The Hamites** ([1 Chronicles 1:8-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+chronicles+1%3A8-16&version=KJV))

([6](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-6.htm)) And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. ([7](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-7.htm)) And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. ([8](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-8.htm)) And Cush begat [Nimrod](/keys/ATh-NMRD): he began to be a mighty one in the earth. ([9](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-9.htm)) He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. ([10](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-10.htm)) And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. ([11](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-11.htm)) Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded [Nineveh](/keys/ATh-NINVH), and the city [Rehoboth](/keys/VATh-RChBTh), [and Calah](/keys/VATh-KLCh), ([12](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-12.htm)) [And Resen](/keys/VATh-RSN) between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. ([13](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-13.htm)) And Mizraim begat [Ludim](/keys/ATh-LVDIM), [and Anamim](/keys/VATh-ANMIM), [and Lehabim](/keys/VATh-LHBIM), [and Naphtuhim](/keys/VATh-NPThChIM), ([14](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-14.htm)) [And Pathrusim](/keys/VATh-PThRSIM), [and Casluhim](/keys/VATh-KSLChIM), (out of whom came Philistim), [and Caphtorim](/keys/VATh-KPThRIM).

([15](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-15.htm)) And Canaan begat [Sidon](/keys/ATh-TzIDN) his firstborn, [and Heth](/keys/VATh-ChTh), ([16](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-16.htm)) [And the Jebusite](/keys/VATh-HIBVSI), [and the Amorite](/keys/VATh-HAMRI), [and the Girgasite](/keys/HGRGShI), ([17](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-17.htm)) [And the Hivite](/keys/VATh-HChVI), [and the Arkite](/keys/VATh-HORQI), [and the Sinite](/keys/VATh-HSINI), ([18](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-18.htm)) [And the Arvadite](/keys/VATh-HARVDI), [and the Zemarite](/keys/VATh-HTzMRI), [and the Hamathite](/keys/VATh-HChMThI): and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. ([19](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-19.htm)) And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. ([20](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-20.htm)) These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

**The Semites** ([1 Chronicles 1:17-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+chronicles+1%3A17-27&version=KJV))

([21](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-21.htm)) Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. ([22](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-22.htm)) The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. ([23](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-23.htm)) And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. ([24](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-24.htm)) And Arphaxad begat [Salah](/keys/ATh-ShLCh); and Salah begat [Eber](/keys/ATh-OBR). ([25](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-25.htm)) And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. ([26](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-26.htm)) And Joktan begat [Almodad](/keys/ATh-ALMVDD), [and Sheleph](/keys/VATh-ShLP), [and Hazarmaveth](/keys/VATh-ChTzRMVTh), [and Jerah](/keys/VATh-IRCh), ([27](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-27.htm)) [And Hadoram](/keys/VATh-HDVRM), [and Uzal](/keys/VATh-AVZL), [and Diklah](/keys/VATh-DQLH), ([28](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-28.htm)) [And Obal](/keys/VATh-OVBL), [and Abimael](/keys/VATh-ABIMAL), [and Sheba](/keys/VATh-ShBA), ([29](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-29.htm)) [And Ophir](/keys/VATh-AVPR), [and Havilah](/keys/VATh-ChVILH), [and Jobab](/keys/VATh-IVBB): all these were the sons of Joktan. ([30](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-30.htm)) And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. ([31](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-31.htm)) These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

([32](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/10-32.htm)) These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
