## Genesis 12 (KJV)

**The Calling of Abram** ([Genesis 26:1-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+26%3A1-5&version=KJV))

([1](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-1.htm)) Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:

([2](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-2.htm)) And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

([3](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-3.htm)) And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

([4](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-4.htm)) So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. ([5](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-5.htm)) And Abram took [Sarai](/keys/ATh-ShRI) his wife, [and Lot](/keys/VATh-LVT) his brother's son, [and all their substance](/keys/VATh-KL-RKVShM) that they had gathered, [and the souls](/keys/VATh-HNPSh) that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. ([6](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-6.htm)) And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land. ([7](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-7.htm)) And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this [land](/keys/ATh-HARTz): and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. ([8](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-8.htm)) And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. ([9](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-9.htm)) And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

**Abram and Sarai in Egypt**

([10](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-10.htm)) And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. ([11](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-11.htm)) And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: ([12](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-12.htm)) Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. ([13](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-13.htm)) Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. ([14](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-14.htm)) And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld [the woman](/keys/ATh-HAShH) that she was very fair. ([15](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-15.htm)) The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. ([16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-16.htm)) And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.

([17](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-17.htm)) [And](/keys/VINGO) [the LORD](/keys/IHVH) [plagued](/keys/VINGO) [Pharaoh](/keys/ATh-PROH) and his house with [great plagues](/keys/NGOIM.GDLIM) because of Sarai Abram's wife. ([18](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-18.htm)) And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? ([19](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-19.htm)) Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. ([20](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/12-20.htm)) And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, [and his wife](/keys/VATh-AShThV), [and all that he had](/keys/VATh-KL-AShR-LV).
