> It is the [Observation](/english?word=Observation) of such as skill [Dreams](/english?word=Dreams), That to [travel](/english?word=travel) a [long way](/english?word=long+way), and [all alone](/english?word=all+alone), is a [sign](/english?word=sign) of [Death](/english?word=Death). This it seems the [Poet](/english?word=Poet) knew: for when the [Queen](/english?word=Queen) of [Carthage](/english?word=Carthage) was to [dye](/english?word=dye) for [Love](/english?word=Love), he [fits](/english?word=fits) her with his Melancholy [Vision](/english?word=Vision):

> Now the [use](/english?word=use) I make of it, is [this](/english?word=this): I would be so [wise](/english?word=wise), as to [prognosticate](/english?word=prognosticate). I do therefore promise my [present Work](/english?word=present+Work) not only [Life](/english?word=Life), but [Acceptance](/english?word=Acceptance): for in this my [Dream](/english?word=Dream) (and I [know](/english?word=know) you will call it [so](/english?word=so)) I [travel](/english?word=travel) not without [Company](/english?word=Company). There were some

> some [Gentlemen](/english?word=Gentlemen) besides my [self](/english?word=self), who affected this [Fame](/english?word=Fame), and thought it no [Disparagement](/english?word=Disparagement) to their [own](/english?word=own): but it was their [pleasure](/english?word=pleasure) it should receive [light](/english?word=light) at my [hands](/english?word=hands), and this made them [defer](/english?word=defer) their own [Copies](/english?word=Copies), which otherwise had past the Press. I have, [Reader](/english?word=Reader), but little more to say, unless I tell thee of my [Justice](/english?word=Justice), and now thou shalt see how [distributive](/english?word=distributive) it is. The [Translation](/english?word=Translation) of the [Fama](/latin?word=Fama) belongs to an [unknown hand](/english?word=unknown+hand), but the [Abilities](/english?word=Abilities) of the [Translator](/english?word=Translator) I question not. He hath indeed mistaken [Damascus](/english?word=Damascus) for [Damcar](/english?word=Damcar) in [Arabia](/english?word=Arabia), and this I would not [alter](/english?word=alter), for I am no [Pedant](/english?word=Pedant) to [correct](/english?word=correct) another mans [Labours](/english?word=Labours). The [Copy](/english?word=Copy) was communicated to [me](/english?word=me) by a [Gentleman](/english?word=Gentleman) more [learned](/english?word=learned) then myself, and I should [name](/english?word=name) him [here](/english?word=here), but that he expects not either [thy thanks](/english?word=thy+thanks) or [mine](/english?word=mine). As for the [Preface](/english?word=Preface), it is my [own](/english?word=own), and I wish thee the full [Benefit](/english?word=Benefit) of it, which certainly thou canst not [miss](/english?word=miss), if thou com'st to it with [clear eyes](/english?word=clear+eyes), and a [purged spirit](/english?word=purged+spirit). Consider that [Prejudice](/english?word=Prejudice) obstructs thy [Judgment](/english?word=Judgment): for if thy [Affections](/english?word=Affections) are [engag'd](/english?word=engag+d), though to an [Ignis fatuus](/latin?word=Ignis+fatuus), thou dost think it a [Guide](/english?word=Guide), because thou

> thou dost [follow](/english?word=follow) it. It is not [Opinion](/english?word=Opinion) makes Things [False](/english?word=False) or [True](/english?word=True): for [men](/english?word=men) have [deny'd](/english?word=deny+d) a great [part](/english?word=part) of the [World](/english?word=World), which [now](/english?word=now) they [inhabit](/english?word=inhabit): and [America](/english?word=America) as well as the [Philosophers Stone](/english?word=Philosophers+Stone), was [sometimes](/english?word=sometimes) in the [Predicament](/english?word=Predicament) of [Impossibilities](/english?word=Impossibilities). There is [nothing](/english?word=nothing) more [absurd](/english?word=absurd), then to be of the [same mind](/english?word=same+mind) with the [Generality](/english?word=Generality) of [Men](/english?word=Men), for they have [entertain'd](/english?word=entertain+d) many [gross Errors](/english?word=gross+Errors), which [Time](/english?word=Time) and [Experience](/english?word=Experience) have [confuted](/english?word=confuted). It is indeed our [Sluggishness](/english?word=Sluggishness) and [Incredulity](/english?word=Incredulity) that hinder all [Discoveries](/english?word=Discoveries), for men [contribute nothing](/english?word=contribute+nothing) towards [them](/english?word=them) but their [Contempt](/english?word=Contempt), or, which is [worst](/english?word=worst), their [Malice](/english?word=Malice). I have known [all this](/english?word=all+this) my [self](/english?word=self), and therefore I [tell](/english?word=tell) it [thee](/english?word=thee): but what [use](/english?word=use) thou wilt [make](/english?word=make) of it, I know not. To make [thee](/english?word=thee) what [Man](/english?word=Man) should [be](/english?word=be), is not in my [power](/english?word=power), but it is [much](/english?word=much) in thy [own](/english?word=own), if thou [know'st](/english?word=know+st) thy [Duty](/english?word=Duty) to thy [self](/english?word=self). Think of it, and Farewell.

### The Epistle to the Wise and Understanding Reader

[p.15-16](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/n15/mode/2up)

> Wisdom (saith [Solomon](/english?word=Solomon)) is to a man an infinite Treasure, fo she is the Breath of the Power of God, and a pure Influence that floweth from the Glory of the Almighty; she is the Brightness of Eternal Light, and an undefiled Mirror of the Majesty of God, and an Image of his Goodness; she teaches Soberness and Prudence, Righteousness and Strength; she understands the Subtilty of words, and Solution of dark sentences; she foreknoweth Signs and Wonders, and what shall happen in time to come; with this Treasure was our first Father [Adam](/english?word=Adam) fully endued: Hence it doth appear, that after God had brought before him allo the Creatures of the Field, and the Fowls under Heaven, he gave to every one of them their proper names, according to their nature.

> Although now through the sorrowful fall into sin this excellent Jewel [Wisdom](/english?word=Wisdom) has been lost, and meer Darkness and Ignorance is come into the World, yet notwithstanding hath the Lord God sometimes

[p.17-18](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/n17/mode/2up)

> sometimes hitherto bestowed, and made manifest the same, to some of his Friends: For the wise King [Solomon](/english?word=Solomon) doth testifie of himself, that he upon earnest prayer and desire did get and obtain such Wisdom of God, that thereby he knew how the World was created, thereby he understood the Nature of the Elements, also the time, beginning, middle, and end, the increase and decrease, the change of times through the whole Year, the Revolution of the Year, and Ordinance of the Stars; he understood also the properties of tame and wilde Beasts, the cause of the raigning of the Winds, and minds and intents of men, all sorts and natures of Plants, vertues of Roots, and others, was not unknown to him. Now I do not think that there can be found any one who would not wish and desire with all his heart to be the Partaker of this noble Treasure; but seeing the same Felicity can happen to none, except God himself give Wisdom, and send his holy Spirit afrom above, we have therefore set forth in print this little Treatise, to wit, [Famam & Confessionem](/latin?word=Famam+Confessionem), of the Laudable Fraternity of the Rosie Cross, to be read by every one, because in them is clearly shewn and discovered, what concerning it the World hath to expect.

> Although these things may seem somewhat strange, and many may esteem it to be but a Philosophical

[p.19-20](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/n19/mode/2up)

> Philosophical shew, and no true History, which is published and spoken of the [Fraternity](/english?word=Fraternity) of the [Rosie Cross](/english?word=Rosie+Cross); it shall here sufficiently appear by our [Confession](/english?word=Confession), that there is more [in recessu](/latin?word=in+recessu) then may be imagined; and it shall be easily understood, and observed by every one (if he be not altogether voyd of understanding) what now adays, and at these times, is meant thereby.

> Those who are true Disciples of [Wisdom](/english?word=Wisdom), and true Followers of the [Spherical Art](/english?word=Spherical+Art), will consider better of these things, and have them in greater estimation, as also judg far otherwise of them, as hath been done by some principal Persons, but especially of [Adam Haselmeyer](/english?word=Adam+Haselmeyer), [Notarius Publicus](/latin?word=Notarius+Publicus) to the Arch Duke [Maximilian](/english?word=Maximilian), who likewise hath made an Extract [ex scriptis Theologicis Theophrasti](/latin?word=ex+scriptis+Theologicis+Theophrasti), and written a Treatise under the Title of [Jesuiter](/english?word=Jesuiter), wherein he willeth, that every Christian should be a true Jesuit, that is, to walk, live, be, and remain in [Jesus](/english?word=Jesus): he was but ill rewarded of the Jesuits, because in his Answer written upon the [Famam](/latin?word=Famam), he did name those of the [Fraternity](/english?word=Fraternity) of the [Rosie Cross](/english?word=Rosie+Cross), [The highly illuminated men, and undeceiving Jesuits](/english?word=The+highly+illuminated+men,+and+undeceiving+Jesuits); for they not able to brook this, layd hands on him, and put him into the [Calleis](/english?word=Calleis), for which they likewise have to expect their reward.

[p.21-22](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/n21/mode/2up)

> Blessed [Aurora](/english?word=Aurora) will now henceforth begin to appear, who (after the passing away of the dark Night of [Saturn](/english?word=Saturn)) with her Brightness altogether extinguisheth the shining of the Moon, or the small Sparks of Heavenly [Wisdom](/english?word=Wisdom), which yet remaineth with men, and is a Forerunner of pleasant [Phebus](/english?word=Phebus), who whith his clear and fiery glistering Beams brings forth that blessed Day, long wished for, of many true-hearted; by which Day-light then shall truly be known, and shall be seen all heavenly Tresures of godly Wisdom, as also the Secrets of all hidden and unvisible things in the World, according to the Doctrine of our Forefathers, and ancient Wisemen.

> This will be the right kingly [Ruby](/english?word=Ruby), and most excellent shining [Carbuncle](/english?word=Carbuncle), of the which it is said, That he doth shine and give light in darkness, and to be a perfect Medicine of all imperfect Bodies, and to change them into the best Gold, and to cure all Diseases of Men, easing them of all pains and miseries.

> Be therefore, gentle Reader, adminished, that with me you do earnestly pray to God, that it please him to open the hearts and ears of all ill hearing people, and to grant unto them his blessing, that they may be able to know him in his Omnipotency, with

[p.23](https://archive.org/stream/fameconfessionof00vaug#page/n23/mode/2up)

> admiring contemplation of Nature, to his honour and praise, and to the love, help, comfort and strengthening of our Neighbors, and to the restoring of all the diseased.
