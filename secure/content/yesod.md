> Foundation. [The Ninth Sephirah](9). The Purified Intelligence. The automatic consciousness or the reproductive activity of the Mars force. The subconscious mind, represented also by the letter [Gimel](/keys/G). The reflection of Tiphareth (the Sun) through [Key 14](14). Also receives influences from Netzach (through Key 17) and Hod (through Key 19). The Anima Mundi, the Soul of the World or Vital Soul in human personality. The working or operative force and basis of every physical form. Consciousness of Theoricus in Rosicrucian initiation. see [87](87), [220](220), [363](363), [430](430), [581](581). The procreative organs of Adam Qadmon, the Archetypal Man. Here the powers of Chokmah and Binah are combined. Samekh represents the form-giving power which supports all forms below it. *[Gematria PFC]*

> *Thus in יסוד, Yesod, is the combination of Mercury, Jupiter, Moon and Venus; and these are, of course, the metals of the alchemists, or the interior stars. Mars impels the upward flow of power on the Way of Return, and this power is combined with Moon and Venus in the work, as it begins in Malkuth and sends the forces up through the path of Tav. But in יסוד, Yesod, Mars and Saturn give place to Jupiter, and the path of Samekh above Yesod is doubly related to Jupiter, as you may see from the letters ס and כ. But the "matter of the work" is designated by מ between ס and כ, and this water will not wet the hand; it will not, that is, wet the Yod. For the "hand" is none else but Yod.* [Comment of Qabalistic Text - 10th Communication 5/19/47]

> *"...the alchemists say there are two stages at the end of their process, the White Work and the Red. White for the Moon, and Red for the Sun.*

> *Now, the Sphere of the Moon is Yesod, and the Sphere of the Sun is Tiphareth. The White Work transmutes the leaden Guph into the Purified Intelligence of Yesod, for it shows the alchemist what is the real basis of his personal life."* [Commentary 11th Communication 5.23.47] see [89](89), [406](406).

> *"Through countless generations that Life perpetuateth Its utterance by means of successive generations of human bodies. It is on this account that the Wise aver that in Yesod is the field of renewal through procreation....*

> *"Never have the Sons of the Wise forgotten this, nor have they ever blasphemed the source of Life. Yet have they known full well that not through generation only is the command 'be fruitful and multiply' to be fulfilled. There is a fruitfulness beyond that of the flesh, and a multiplication of the power of life beyond the bringing forth of sons and daughters of the flesh. Thus in the word Yesod, may you read Yod, Sod - or Sod, Yod the secret of Yod....*

> *"forms are manifest in varying degrees, and when it is thine office to bring forth subtle forms, thou failest if thou miss thine opportunity through the false belief that in the bringing forth of forms less subtle there is any essential failure.* [Qabalistic Text - 27th Communication 1/15/48]. see [363](363), [23](23), [11](11), [430](430).

> In [Leviticus 4:7](http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm): *"And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is the tabernacile of the congregation; and he shall pour all the rest of the blood of the bullock at the **foundation** of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation."* see [430](430).

> The Zohar [IV: 225A, p. 268] Comments: *"Observe that when the priest spreads his hands at the time he blesses the people, the Shekinah comes and hovers over him and endows him with power. [Literally, fills his hands] When blessing, the priest raises his right hand above the left, so as to cause the right to prevail over the left. All the grades over which he spreads his hands, are thus blessed from the source of all things, from the well called righteous [i.e. יסוד, Yesod] the source of all is the future world, the sublime source which illumines all faces, whence are kindled all lamps. It has a counterpart in the source and spring of the well whence all the lower lamps and the lower lights are kindled and radiate. So one corresponds to the other. Hence, when the priest spreads out his hands and begins to pronounce the blessing over the people, the celestial benedictions flowing form the celestial source at once kindle the lamps, and faces are illumined, and the community of Israel is adorned with celestial crowns, and all those blessing from down from on high to below."*

> The Aesch Mezareph [VII, p. 38] says: *"Yesod, in natural things, contains under itself Quicksilver; because this metal is the foundation of the whole art of transmutation."*

> Mrs. Atwood comments: *"None better than the ancient (who profess to have enjoyed the rational life in its most intimate spheres, and have reaped its most real and lasting advantages), describe the folly and fatal allurements to which they are subjected who trust thereselves to remain passively dreaming in the region of the phantasy, with its notion and instincts, often more false, fleeting* [text continues and is missing]

Y="Hand" S="Prop" V="Nail" D="Door". It seems this sequence describes a process for propping the door to subconscious "open." This is done by becoming an unobstructed channel for the wisdom of the One Life.
