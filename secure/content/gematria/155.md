### [libertas evangelii](/latin?word=libertas+evangelii) (Lt)
> the liberty of the Gospels. In the Fama written round the circle containing the picture of an eagle, or scorpio-water. see [564](564).

> > *"...it refers to the 'good news of freedom' which is the burden of the New Testament. That 'good news' has for its essential principle the idea represented by the name Jesus, which means 'the nature of reality is to set free'. Jesus and Joshua are two forms of the same name, and the Old Testament tells us that Joshua, who succeeded Moses as leader of the children of Israel, was the son of Nun. That is, his father's name was the same as the name of the letter connected by Qabalists with the sign Scorpio. Just as the leadership of Joshua follows that of Moses, so does the fulfillment of the ancient law by Jesus succeed its earlier manifestations of sacrifice.*

> > *"similarly, after preliminary purifications of yoga and alchemy (the yoke of the law) #[113](113) comes the liberation of the good news which is heard by the initiate through the transmutation of the scorpio energies. Thus the Rosicrucian allegory tells us that when brother C.R.C. had overcome the feebleness of his body during his stay of Damascus #[444](444) he heard of the wise men at Damcar #[264](264), went to their temple, and received from them good news, not only as to the significance of events that had happened while he was yet in the closter of the sense-life, but also concerning the true meaning of the world of nature.*

> > *"This good news is associated with the eagle, as a symbol of the regenerated activities of the Scorpio force, connected with the element of water, always a symbol of purification. Hence we find the alchemist directing their pupils to wash the matter many times, and then, say they, the great wonder will appear to you. Similarly, when this purification is accomplished we have borrowed strength from the eagle, and have eyes with which to see and recognize the great truth that every thing in our environment works for liberty, and not for human bondage."*

> [[Paul Case: True and Invisible, (Weiser), pp. 125](https://archive.org/stream/PaulFosterCase-TheTrueAndInvisibleRosicrucianOrder4thEd-1985#page/n131)] see [326](326), [106](106), [700](700), [50](50).
