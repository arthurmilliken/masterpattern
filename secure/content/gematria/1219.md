### [Ichthys](/greek?word=ichthus) (Gr) - Ιχθύς
> Fish. The Greek equivalent for the Hebrew lettername [Nun](/keys/NVN) (נון). The great symbol of the early Christian. *"...by drawing the fish on the ground, where it could be instantly erased, members of the early Christian secret society tested strangers and made themselves know to each other... the initials of the Greek sentence meaning 'Jesus Christ, son of God, Savior,' spell the Greek noun Ichthys, fish."* [True and Invisible, page 44]. see 106, 700.

> *"Alchemists 'might have known that the numeration of Ichthys by Greek Gematria is 1219, and that 1219 is also [23](23) (the number of חיה, [Chaiah](/keys/ChIH), the name for Life-force) multiplied by [53](53) (the number of אבן, the Hebrew known meaning: stone), used by more than one alchemist to designate the philosopher's stone, which stone was also the Elixir of immortality.'"*
