### [nachayla beli mitzraim](/keys/NChLH.BLI.MTzRIM) - נחלה בלי מצרים
> possessio sine angustias. "possession without want" (tribulation, distress, straightness). The Hebrew translates "possession without distress." The word mitzriam means Egypt [From MTzR distress, straits; boundary; narrow pass]. see [380](380). To possess is to rejoice in freedom from oppression. Rosenroth in [K.D.L.C.K. p.569] says this phrase alludes to Binah.

### [tiphaylaw](/keys/ThPLH) - תפלה
> unsavourness, unseemliness, impropriety, folly. [From ThPL tasteless, unseasoned; plaster, whitewash, untempered mortar]. see [510](510), [859](859). Folly is oppression of man; it is the "second" beast; which is tamed by prayer and meditation.

### [tepilhuh](/keys/ThPLH) - תפלה
> phylactery; parchment inscribed with scriptural text. Worn by Jews on the forehead and left arm near the heart; tefillah, the prayer of the amidah.

> In Jewish antiquity, the parchment was enclosed within a small leather case which was fastened with straps on the forehead just above and between the eyes and left arm. The 4 passages written on the phylactery were [Exodus 13:2,9,10,16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+13%3A2%2C9%2C10%2C16&version=AKJV;WLC) (2) *"Sanctity unto me all the first-born, whatsoever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine; (9) and it shall be a sign unto thee upon thine head, and for a memorial between then eyes, that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand has the Lord brought thee out of Egypt; (10) thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year; (16) And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the Lord brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand".*

> And [Deuteronomy 6:4,9; 11:13-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6%3A4%2C9%3B+11%3A13-23&version=AKJV;WLC): (4)*"Hear O Israel: the Lord our God is one God." (9) "Write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates." (13) "So if you faithful obey the commands I am giving you today-to love the Lord your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. (14) then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and oil. (15) I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. (16) Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them. (17) Then the Lord's anger will burn against you, and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish form the good land the Lord is giving to you. (18) Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. (19) Teach them to our children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. (20) Write them on the door frames of our houses and on your gates, (21) so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the Lord swore to give your forefathers, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth. (22) If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow-to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways and to hold fast to him-(23) then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you."*

> The custom was founded on a literal interpretation of [Exodus 13:16](http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-16.htm) and [Deuteronomy 6:8](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm) *"Do what is right and good in the Lord's sight, so that it may go will with you and you may go in and take over the good land that the Lord promised on oath to your forefathers."* Among the primitive Christians, this was a case in which they enclosed the relics of the dead. Also, any charm, spell or amulet worn as a preservative form danger or disease. [Greek phy-lak-terion, from phylassein, to defend or guard - Webster].

> Rosenroth in [K.D.L.C.K. p.738] says that this is a name for Malkuth, because within it congregate all the sephiroth.

### [shoter](/keys/ShVTR) - שוטר

Rosenroth in [K.D.L.C.K. p.707] says that when Malkuth is the thong of the whip falling on the godless, Tiphareth is the helper or aid which strikes. Suggests the testing of the holy guardian angel in Key 14 via the path of Samekh.
