### [Maftayakh Beth David](/keys/MPThCh.BITh-DVD) - מפתח בית־דוד
> Key of the house of David. [Isaiah 22:22](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-22.htm): *"And the Key of the House of David will I lay upon his shoulder; none shall open."*

> *This is the key of the knowledge of immortality. "And that House is the temple, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." ([2 Corinthians 5:1](http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm)). Thus the key is the secret which gives power to open the temple, and enter there in, even to the Holy of Holies. Here is a clue to the reader will do well to follow up in his meditations.*

> *"...954, which is 53x18. Since 18 is the number of חי [chai](/keys/ChI) (life, health), and 53 is the number of אבן, [Ehben](/keys/ABN) (Stone), the multiplication of life by the Stone is indicated by this term, and there is no question that Qabalistic alchemists understood it."* [True and Invisible (WeiserBooks), p. 59]

Note that in [Key 5](5), the kneeling minister on the left reaches for the silver key, which unlocks the gate to Hell ([Revelation 9:1](http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm)), מפתח בית־דוד is the golden key (also represented by the Hierophant's scepter) which unlocks the [House of David](/keys/BITh-DVD), since [David](/keys/DVD) has the same numeration ([14](14)) as [zahab](/keys/ZHB), meaning "gold". See [426](426), [528](528).
