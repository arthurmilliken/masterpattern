In the Pistis Sophia it is said: IOTA (I), because the universe hath gone forth; Alpha (A), because it will turn back again; Omega, because the completion of all completeness will take place." Lydus, in De Mensibus, says IAO is Phoenician and relates it to Dionysus and to Sabaoth. The Eleusianian name for Dionysus was Iacchus.
