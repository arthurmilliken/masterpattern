## 1116 - One Thousand One Hundred Sixteen

4x9x31 (2x2 x 3x3 x 31)

### [Kether Malkuth](/keys/KThR.MLKVTh) - כתר מלכות

> "The Crown of the Kingdom." It is a familiar Qabalistic saying that Kether is in Malkuth, and Malkuth in Kether.

The Reduction of 1116 is 9, which is Yesod, which is indeed the crown of Malkuth, in the same way that Tiphareth is the crown of Yesod, and Kether is the crown of Tiphareth. It is the union of the Son with the Father, and the union of the Father with the Mother (and by proxy the union of the Son with the Mother) which is the source of manifestation for the physical universe.
