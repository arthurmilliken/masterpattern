> James Pryse: *"Serene patience is one of the indispensable qualification of the aspirant for spiritual knowledge, and so is the 'ruling' or dominance of the higher intellect, the nous (iesous), over the lower faculties. The ordeal (thipsis) is that of initiation, now begun. Through the awakening noetic perception (the 'evidence of Jesus') and the increasing light form the Logos-the whitening of the dawn of the new life-the aspirant becomes isolated, and in the drear loneness of one who has for ever abandoned the illusions of sensuous existence, but has not seen the sunrise of the spirit, he dwells as it were, on an island, apart form his fellow-men".* [The Apocalypse Unsealed, p.88]
