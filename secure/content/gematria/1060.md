### [saykel nisetar](/keys/ShKL.NSThR) - שכל נסתר
> Hidden or Occult Intelligence. The 7th path of Netzach. From the verb sawther [SThR], to hide, to veil, to cover, to conceal. Nesether, the Seventh Path, called the Hidden or Occult Intelligence [SKL NSThR], Saykel nesether, from the verb sawther, [SChR], to hide, to veil, to cover, to conceal. This veiling has to do with the way desire manifests in human consciousness. We begin our journey toward adeptship while still deluded by the dream of personal separateness caused by the illusions of embodied consciousness. When we desire something we want it, and this means we seem to lack whatever we want. To the eye of sense there is no visible evidence that we really possess what we desire. When, however, we understand that the whole creation is mental we realize that the desires rising into our personal consciousness are intimations of what is already prepared for us. In the Briatic world all strong desires are actualities.
