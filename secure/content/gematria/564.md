### [eheben ha-roshah](/keys/ABN.HRAShH) - אבן הראשה
> the head-stone. [Zechariah 4:7](http://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-7.htm): *"Who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it."*

> Zerubbabel means 'offspring of Babel" or "grief of Babel" and is recognized as the rebuider of Jerusalem and the temple after the Babylonian exile- Standard Bible Dictionary. see [241](241). The pinnacle stone of a pyramid. [Lapis Capitalis](/latin?word=Lapis+Capitalis) ([133](133)). The passage cited is a very important one. Some have thought the headstone was the Key-stone of the arch; but actually it is the pinnacle of a pyramid, the capstone which is at once a determinant and the completion of the building. For the pinnacle stone of a pyramid is itself a scale model of the whole pyramid's proportions. see [1214](1214), [1276](1276) (Greek), [53](53), [801](801).

### [vayehi ha-adam le-nefesh chaiah](/keys/VIHI.HADM.LNPSh.ChIH) - ויהי האדם לנפש חיה
> And man became a living soul. [Genesis 2:7](http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm): *"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; **and man became a living soul**."*

> Explained in the Greater Holy Assembly (Zohar) as a reference to the physical Body of Man. [I.R.Q. 941]: *"And Adam was formed into a living soul, so that it (the physical nefesh form) might be attached to himself (otherwise, so that it might be developed in him), and that he might form himself into similar conformations; and that he might project himself in that Neshamah from path into path, even unto the end and completion of all the paths. That is into conformations similar to those of the supernal man."* see [1124](1124).

### [Kholem Yesodoth](/keys/ChLM.ISVDVTh) - חלם יסודות
> Breaker of the Foundations. The Sphere of the Elements; the part of the material world corresponding to Malkuth. The field in which the fundamental unity of cosmic substance appears to be broken up. The verb חלם, [khahalam](/keys/ChLM), means primarily "to bind," and by indirect reference to the way in which one is bound by the conditions of a dream while the latter continues, is also the Hebrew for "to dream." The other translation "breaker" seems to be a reference to the separative power active in Malkuth. The four elements attributed to Malkuth are not things in the universe, but mental concepts, at the same time they are the subtle principles of sight (Fire), taste (Water), touch (Air), and smell (Earth). see [496](496), [31](31), [55](55), [80](80), [95](95), [471](471).

### [Mae Shihor](/keys/MI.ShChVR) - מי שחור
> Water of Shihor [Jeremiah 2:18](http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm): *"And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the **waters of Sihor**? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?"*

> [shihor](/keys/ShChVR), שחור,  means: dinginess, sootiness, black, charred, melancholy. Thus the "Waters of Shihor" refers to illusion. One may see by their connection with the passage cited, with the "Way of Egypt." Egypt symbolizes the sphere of sensation associated with Malkuth, and the "Waters of Dinginess" are sense impressions which conceal reality, as cloudy water hides what it contains.

### [Chanokh](/keys/ChNVKf) - חנוך

### [Heh Phemeh](/greek?word=h+phhmh) (Gr) - η φήμη
> The Report (Fama). In the Greek dictionary it is defined as:

> 1. a Voice from heaven; a prophetic voice; an oracle, an augury;
> 2. a speech, saying, song.
> 3. A common saying, an old tradition, legend.
> 4. like the Latin Fama, a rumor, report.
> 5. a message.

> The Fama is a book which the Rosicrucians themselves declare to be a veiled, allegorical expression. Just as the Bible has been misinterpreted by those who take it literally, so has the Fama brought nothing but confusion to the minds of those who take it at its face value, as the story of an actual man who founded a German secret society. see [20](20).
