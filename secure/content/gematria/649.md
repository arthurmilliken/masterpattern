### [tardamah](/keys/ThRDMH) - תרדמה
> trance, deep sleep. Fabre D'Olivet comments: *"ThRDMH a sympathetic slumber... This is a kind of lethargy or somnambulism which takes possession of the sentient faculties and suspends them; as is testified by the Chaldaic NRDM and even the Arabic... The hieroglyphic compositon of the Hebrew word is remarkable. It can cause strange reflections anent certain modern discoveries. The two contracted roots RD-RM, express the first, that which extends and takes possession by a proper movement; the other that which is similar, homogeneous and conformable to universal nature. The sign of mutual reciprocity Tav and the emphatic article Heh are here a the beginning and the end, to increase the energy of this mysterious word."*

> *"After the analysis of this word, one cannot fail to recognize that extraordinary condition, to which the moderns have given the name of magnetic sleep, or somnambulism, and which one might perhaps designate, as in Hebrew, sympathetic sleep, or simply sympatheticism. I must moreover state that the Hellenists who say ε στασ , a trance are not so far form the truth as Saint Jerome who merely says 'soporem' a deep sleep."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp.87-88]

### [targum](/keys/ThRGVM) - תרגום‬
> *The targumim were spoken paraphrases, explanations and expansions of the Jewish scriptures (also called the Tanakh) that a rabbi would give in the common language of the listeners...* [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum)]

This is "a parchment called T", mentioned in the [Fama](https://archive.org/stream/PaulFosterCase-TheTrueAndInvisibleRosicrucianOrder4thEd-1985#page/n23): *"In his hand he held a parchment called T, the which next to the Bible is our greatest treasure, which ought not to be delivered to the censure of the world."*
