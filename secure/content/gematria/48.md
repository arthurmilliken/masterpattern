> According to Fabre D'Olivet: *"חם. Ham... this name is on the whole, the opposite of that of Shem. The sign Cheth which constitutes it, recalls all ideas of effort, of obstacle, or fatigue of travail. The root which result from its union with the sign of exterior action, employed as collective, presents a bending, a dejection, a thing which inclines toward the lower parts: it is the heat which follows a sharp compression: it is the hidden fire of nature: it is the warmth which accompanies the rays of the sun; it is the dark color, the blackness, which results from their action; it is finally, in the broadest sense, the sun itself considered as the cause of heat and of torrefaction.*

> *When the name of Ham is presented alone and in an absolute sense, it can be taken in a good sense, since it expresses the effect of the sun upon inferior bodies; but if one only sees in it the opposite of Shem, it offers only sinister ideas. If Shem is the sublime, the superior, Ham is the abased, the inferior; so if the former is the radiant, the exalted, the infinite, the latter is the obscure, the bending, the limited, etc.* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p. 170-171]
