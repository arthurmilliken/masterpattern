### [Japheth](/keys/IPTh) - יפת
> Expansion; One of Noah's 3 sons. Refers to the diffusion of energy through innumerable forms. see [936](936). [Genesis 9:27](https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-27.htm): *"God **shall enlarge** Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant."*

> Fabre D'Olivet comments: *"יפת [Japeth](/keys/IPTh)... This name holds a sort of medium between those of Shem and Ham, and partakes of their good or evil qualities without having them in itself. it signifies, in a generic sense, material extent, indefinite space: in a more restricted sense, latitude. the root פת, from which it comes, contains every idea of expansion, of facility to extend, to allow itself to be penetrated; every solution, every divisibility, every simplification. It is governed by the sign of potential manifestation Yod, which adds to its force and universalizes it...Compare diligently, the three sons of Adam with those of Noah... The first production of Adam, after his fall, is Kain [[160](160)]; the second Habel [[37](37)]; the third, Sheth [[700](700)]. Moses, for very strong reasons, inverted the order of similitudes of the productions of Noah. Shem [340], whom he names the first, in this instance, corresponds with Habel, whom he has named second in the other; Ham, whom he names second, corresponds with Kain, whom he has named first; Japheth, who correspond with Sheth preserves with him the same rank. It is without doubt very difficult to know what Moses has concealed under the symbolic names of Kain, Habel and Sheth: but if one wishes to admit that this may be the three constituent principles of the being called Adam, that is to say, the developed, or decomposed triad of the collective unity, he will soon perceive that the symbolic names of Ham, Shem and Japheth, are the constituted priciples of the being called Noah, and that these cosmogonic personages are related one to the other, in the same manner as the effect is related to its cause."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp. 171-173]
