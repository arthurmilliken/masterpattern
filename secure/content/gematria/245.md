###/keys/KL-PNI HADMH kawl-penay ha-adamah
> "The whole face of the ground". [Genesis 2:6] "But there went up a mist form the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground." F.J. Mayers comments: "Whatever it was that 'emanated' from the earth (AD, 5) it was something that had to make its influence felt in the 'Adamah'- something of a spiritual nature; it was something that had to take part in preparing the spiritual element from which 'Adam' was to be formed. We have already seen that Adam was created as a universal spiritual being, and also as a human kingdom of individuals of a physical plane. It was necessary then that Adam should be first formed in the spirit world, of spiritual 'human' elements, and then attracted to the physical plane to be 'formed' into physical individual men and women... At the point which our study of the narrative has reached a connection had to be formed between the physical plane 'earth' and the Adamah, so a 'focre' or 'influence' 'emanated' from the earth and ascended into the spiritual plane, contacted it and was absorbed by it. The earthly and the spiritual (to use the suggestions conveyed by the word Ishekah) embraced or kissed one another, inclined themselves to one another so that a mutual attraction linked or kissed one another, inclined themselves to one another so that a mutual attraction linked them together." [The Unknown God, pp.118-119] HNTzNIM ha-nitzanim. "the blossom". In the Prologue to the Zohar [I:p.3] "Rabbi Simeon opened his discourse with the text: The blossoms appeared on the earth, etc. 'The blossoms', he said 'refer to the work of creation. Appeared on the earth: when? On the third day, as it is written, "and the earth brought forth" They thus then appeared of the earth.'"
