### [vayomer labrim yadoa teda ki-ger](/keys/VIAMR.LABRM.IDO.ThDO.KI-GR) - ויאמר לאברם ידע תדע כי־גר

"And he said to Abram, 'surely know that strangers'". ([Genesis 15:13](https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm)): _"**And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety** that thy seed shall be **a stranger** in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;"_

This gematria carries the implication that, being servants and strangers in a strange land will serve to purify the Israelite people, and make them loyal to each other and to their God. [Paul](https://biblehub.com/greek/paulo__3972.htm) (see below) was also a "stranger" among Christians, as a man who persecuted Christians before his miraculous conversion; and was thus wholly dependent upon Christ for his identity.
