### [IHVH Eloah ve'da'ath](/keys/IHVH.ALH.VDOTh) - יהוה אלה ודעת
> *"That which was, is and will be, strength and knowledge". Divine name of Tiphareth, the 6th Sephirah. Dion Fortune writes; "The God-name of this sphere is Aloah va Daath, which associates it intimately with the invisible sephirah that comes between it and Kether. This sephirah... may best be understood as apprehension, the dawning of consciousness; and we may interpret the phrase 'Tetragrammaton Aloah va Daath' as 'God made manifest in the sphere of mind'... it is here that the initiated adept functions when in the higher consciousness. and it is by... an understanding of the significance of the name of Aloah va Daath that he opens up the higher consciousness."* [the Mystical Qabalah, pp.206-207]. see [1080](1080), [26](26), [36](36), [474](474). For other divine names of the sephiroth see: [37](37), [166](166), [26](26), [86](86), [31](31), [297](297), [525](525), [585](585), [363](363), [155](155).

> [beginning of text missing] ... double letters of the Hebrew alphabet: Th, R, K, D, G, B, corresponding to the seven inner holy planets, and to the seven sephiroth from Binah to Yesod, or the creative (Briatic) and formative (Yetziratic) worlds. [KPVL = multiplication; KPVLH = fold]. "Doors suggest imaginative potencies inherent in Daleth, and expressed in all the double letter. They are hidden, or folded from the ignorant, and unfold the intelligible world to the wise. This is the "Mountain of the Elohim", approached by the sword of discrimination, and the path of dryness, or fiery devotion, purified form false desire.
