### [Leraik](/keys/LRAIKf) - לראיך
> [Kaph = 500]. Leake; Goetic demon by day of the 2nd decanate of Leo. The demons's name suggest mis-guided action (Lamed) and use of regenerative solar force (Resh) in erratic activities (Aleph) resulting in a false sense of personal will (Yod) in an endless quest to manifest that will (Kaph). The 2nd decanate of Leo is ruled by Jupiter and has the qualities: kindly, tolerant, urbane. The influence of this demon suggest conscious imbalance. In the Tarot minor arcana this decanate corresponds to the 6 of Wands, which is the operation of Tiphareth, sphere of the Sun or higher self, in Atziluth, the world of archetypes. When negatively aspected, as here, it can indicate loss though love affairs or by the opposite sex; waste in pleasure and trouble through pride of riches or through intolerance based on success. The remedy to this is correct understanding of the true source of personal egoic feelings.
