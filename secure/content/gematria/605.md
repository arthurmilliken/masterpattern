### [Adam](/keys/ADMf) - אדם
> Man (see 45). [Mem = 600] The Zohar [I:34B. p.130] says: ...the words 'let us make man' [in our image, after our likeness -- [Genesis 1:26](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm)] may be taken to signify that God imparted to the lower beings who came from the side of the upper world the secret of forming the divine name 'Adam', which embraces the upper and the lower in virtue of its three letters, Aleph, Daleth, and Mem final. Paul Case: emphasis on Mem final suggest ADM here = 605 = GBRTh, enclosure, wall, or mistress, sovereign lady.

> Also: [Adhom](/keys/ADMf), red.

But you did not consider these things or reflect on what might happen.'* The queen suggests one of the manes of Malkuth, the physical plane, i.e. the seat of the lower shekinah. see [496](496), [K.D.L.C.K. p.226]

### [Arphaksad](/keys/ARPKShD) - ארפכשד
> Arphaxad, Arpachshad; the third son of Shem and the second in line of descent from Shem to Abraham. [Genesis 10:22](http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm): *"The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram."* see [340](340), [1006](1006). Since the 2nd half of the name is the singular form of Chasdim, or Chaldees, it almost certainly forms here a separate word with that significance. [Standard Bible Dictionary p.236]

> Fabre D'Olivet divides this word (ARP-KShD) and comments: *Restorer of providential nature and says: VARP-KShD, and aprhacheshad... the two words is separate here, are joined in the original; but this conjunction appears to have been the consequence of a mistake of a copyist anterior to Esdras. The first word, ARP, comes form the root RP, which develops all ideas of mediative remedial, restorative, curative cause. United to the sign of stability and power Aleph, it has formed that name, famous in all the ancient mythologies, written ε by the Greeks, and by us, Orpheus. The second word, KShD, nearly as famous, since it was the favorite epithet of the Chaldeans, is derived from the root ShD, applied to providential powers, to productive nature. Thence the name given to God himself, ShDI, providence. In this instance this root ShD, is inflected by the assimilative article Kaph.* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp. 292-293]
