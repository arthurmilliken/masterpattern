### [pereclinus de faustis](/latin?word=pereclinus+de+faustis) (Lt)
> "proven by the hand" or "growing from the hand". Relates to the Zelator. In Latin, *periclitatio* has the meaning of trial or experiment; *periclitor* means to try, test or prove.

> Derived from the greek **περιcλιναλ** *periclinal* or sloping on all sides. In botany, it is applied to the cell walls at a growing point which runs parallel, i.e. in the same direction as the circumference of the circle [circumcision = limitation, i.e. Saturn]. In geology, it is *quaquaversal,* turning or pointing in every direction. In mineralogy *[pericline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericline)* is a variety of Albite occurring in white opaque crystals elongated in the direction of the microdiagonal axis. These crystals are often twins with rotation about an axis in the crystal, hence the method of twinning is called *[pericline twinning](http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/twinning.htm)*. Breakage is easily in two directions at right angles to each other. [Albite is a silicate of Aluminum or sodium, a constituent of the salt crystal]. *Faustis* comes from *faust,* a word of German origin, meaning 'hand', as the Hebrew Yod. It also means clenched fist, suggesting determination. see [135](135) (Greek).
