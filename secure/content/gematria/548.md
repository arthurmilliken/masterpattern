### [Hatzegenoth](/keys/HTzGNTh) - הצגנת
> Night demon of the 3rd decanate of Cancer. The letters of the demon's name suggest the perverted power of vision (Heh) to influence or shape meditation (Tzaddi), and evoke subconscious memory (Gimel) or reproductive evil (Nun), thus limiting the soul's capacity to grow (Tav). This decanate of Cancer is ruled by Neptune and Jupiter and has the qualities: sympathetic, courteous, cermonious. The influence of the demon suggest subconscious imbalance, resulting in negative aspect of these qualities. In the minor tarot arcana this decanate is assigned to the 4 of Cups. This represents the operation of Chesed or cosmic memory, in Briah, the creative world. The demon here can cause material gain, but through injustice; sorrows resulting form satisfaction of desire and getting what one has wanted but find no joy it. The remedy is to make personalty consciously receptive to the control of the one self, thus mental imagery in the substance of Briah becomes formed into right desires with are in harmony with cosmic principles. see [528](528) (העגנת).
