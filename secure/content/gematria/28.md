### [yechud](/keys/IChVD) - יחוד
> union or unity, indicates the fact that the material world, which we misinterpret as the sphere of manyness or multiplicity, is fundamentally the ONE expression of ONE reality, in which there is no separation whatever, each of the seemingly separate parts being combined with all the others. This is a conception made understandable by modern rediscoveries concerning the electrical constitution of matter. see [88](88), [7](7), [22](22), [14](14), [44](44), [21](21), [66](66). Also privacy, private meeting; profession of unity of God (also separation) see [440](440).

### [koach](/keys/KCh) - כח
> power, strength, might. Refers to the magic square of Venus. It represents by its total summation (2800 or 28x100) the formative power of desire. This work locates for us the place were we shall draw the power used in magic and other forms of practical occultism. The power we are to use is a physical power. The power is in plain sight. The alchemists tell us again and again when they intimate that the First Matter of the art is procurable everywhere, and without expense.

> *"The reversal of the letters [כח] forms the word חך, [Khake](/keys/ChK), signifying the mouth as the former of words, or the power of verbal utterance. This power of verbal utterance is held in occult philosophy to be basic in the creation and formation of the universe. It is, indeed, the power which supports all creation, and thus it is appropriate that ?[of]? an area of a great lozenge [formed in the geometrical construction of the Tree of Life] corresponding to חך, Khake, by number should be shown as being what is outside and below the Tree of Life as its support [the number 28]"* [Paul Case: Letter to J.W. Hamilton-Jones March 10, 1952 page 4].
