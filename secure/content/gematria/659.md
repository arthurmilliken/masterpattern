> There came to be silence. [Revelation 8:1](http://biblehub.com/revelation/8-1.htm): *"And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in the heaven about half and hour."*

> The 7th seal or planet is the Mercury center, and the experience is that of cosmic consciousness: *"This chakra, the conarium or pineal body, is the 'third eye' of the seerer-that, and much more. It is the focal point of all the forces of the nervous system and of the aura; here they come to an equilibrium, and here reigns the mystic silence."* [James Pryse: The Apocalypse unsealed, pp.134-135]
