### [Issachar](/keys/IShShKR) - יששכר
> Tribe of Issachar. He will bring a reward. [Genesis 49:14](http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm). Associated with Capricorn and alchemical fermentation. (Note: Godwin associates this with Cancer.) Fermentation involves the process of leavening the personal subconscious with the idea that the Life-power is the universal solvent. When the leaven of superconscious has been received, through suspension of personal identification with events and actions which occur through, rather than by, it begins to operate subconsciously. It agitates and excites through the Saturn center at the base of the spine and its energy is combined with the force of the Mars center. At this stage the animal nature is intensified, but proper selfconscious attention applies it to seeing through the mixtures of appearance in the outer world. Renewal of the mind is thus effected.

> According to Jacob's blessing, *"Issachar is a sturdy ass, lounging among the ravines; he saw that settled life was good, and that the land was pleasant; so he offered his shoulder to bear burdens, and became a gang-slave."* The predominance of Earthy imagery in these lines is made clear by the American Translation. Furthermore, one of the ancient symbols of the sign Capricorn is the ass. see [7](7), [95](95), [30](30), [570](570), [50](50), [54](54), [331](331), [358](358), [708](708).

> *"The 26th path is called the Renewing Intelligence because thereby God... blessed be He!... renews all things that are begun afresh in the creation of the world."* [Yetziratic Text]

### [telahth](/keys/ThLTh) - תלת
> three, third (Aramaic). Suggest that the spirit, as ox-goad (Lamed) is the third principle working between the soul (the 1st Tav or divine soul as world-dancer in Key 21) and the body (the 2nd Tav as representing Saturn and the physical form). In this interpretation Lamed, though work or action, is the "flying serpent". see [430](430).

### [beriyakhim](/keys/BRIChIMf) - בריחים
> bars, bolts, latches; axes, clavicles, shoulder-blades. The same letters may be read to mean: flying serpents. In the Old testament this second meaning is associated with the "crooked serpent" and also called "Leviathan." There is a whole body of secret doctrine behind this reference which connects it with נחש ([358](358)). [Mem = 600] see [270](270).

### [Yahweh be-qirbek](/keys/IHVH.BQRBKf) - יהוה בקרבך
> The LORD in the midst. [Zephaniah 3:15](http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-15.htm): *"The Lord has taken away the judgements, he has cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee: thou shall not see evil anymore."* see [350](350). [Kaph = 500].

### [Hye Kye](/greek?word=hue+kue) (Gr) - Ηυε Κυε
> Esoteric term in Eleusinian rites. Hippolytus, is his refutation of all heresies, says: *"This is the Christ who in all who have been generated is the portrayed son of man from the unportrayable Logos. This is the Great unspeakable mystery of the Eleusinian rites -- Hye Kye."* Here hippolytus is giving an account of the doctrines of the Nasseni, a sect of Christian Gnostics, who worshiped the Logos under the name and image of the serpent. There name is itself form NChSh, Nahkhash. see [130](130), [780](780), [358](358), [17](17).
