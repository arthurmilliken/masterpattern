### [kestos](/greek?word=kestos) (Gr) - κεστος
> Literally, stitched, embroidered. Latin cestus. A girdle, especially the girdle of Aphrodite (Venus), which gave the wearer the power of exiting love. (Paul Case, in his texts, mentioned the "girdle of Venus", but did not give its Greek name). Its number, 895, reduces to [22](22), the number of a circle (the Girdle), and the number of Hebrew letters.
