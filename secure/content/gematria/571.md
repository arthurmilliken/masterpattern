### [metheqela](/keys/MThQLA) - מתקלא
> balance. From תקל [tekel](/keys/ThQL) [Daniel 5:27](http://biblehub.com/daniel/5-27.htm) *"Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting."* Suggests weighing. [Note in the Hebrew Lexicon תקל = to weigh). Thus it leadss to the whole series of ideas represented by Libra, and also to those described in the judgement scenes of the Book of the Dead. According to Mathers, מתקלא applies *"To the two opposite natures in each triad of the Sephiroth, their equilibrium forming the third Sephirah in each trinity."* In other words: 1 is the equilibrium of 2 and 3, which are in balance, 6 is the equilibrium of 4 and 5; 9 and 10 are equilibriums of 7 and 8 [9 interiorly, 10 exteriorly].
