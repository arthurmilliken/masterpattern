> remember. ([Exodus 20:8](https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm)): _"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."_

> The prologue to the Zohar [5B, p.23] comments: _"The highest Sabbath does not come under the injunction of shamor (keep) but is under that of zakhor (remember), which is used in the first version of the 10 commandments [Exodus 20:8], since the supreme king is hinted at in the word zakhor (remember). For this reason he is called 'the king with whom peace dwells', and his peace is within the injunction of zakor (remember). And this is why there is no contention in the supernal realm."_ see [Key 2](/keys/G), [3](3), [83](83), [1513](1513).
