OD ODI OD ad ayedi ad, od odi od. Forever and ever. A phrase used at the end of a section 4, chapter 1 of the Book of Formation, which says "The only Lord God, the Faithful King, rules over all from his holy habitation, for ever and ever." the same book declares also that the "holy habitation" is in "the midst," and is symbolized by the letter Tav. This is Tav at the interior center of the cube of space, as the living spirit pictured in Key 21. see [46](46), [36](36), [260](260), [315](315), [154](154), [224](224), [314](314), [29](29), [400](400), [406](406), [713](713).

ARAL Aeriel. Archangel; ruler of Fire. Ariel, "Lion of God"; used by Jewish mystics as a poetic name for Jerusalem. In Gnostic lore generally he is a ruler of winds and equated with Ialdabaoth as an older name for the god. In practical Cabala he is regarded as originally of the Order of Virtues. According to John Dee, Ariel is a conglomerate of Anael and Uriel. There may a connection between Ariel and the Aralim (the Valiant Ones), an order of angels equated with the Order of Thrones.
