### [raytzawphim](/keys/RTzPIM) - רצפים
> burning coals. [1 Kings 19:6](http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-6.htm): *"And he [Elijah] looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. and he did eat and drink, and laid him down again."* (this was his 40 day's sustenance until he came to Horeb, the mount of God).

### [shilemim](/keys/ShLMIM) - שלמים
> perfection, [wholeness]; peaceable; "peaceableness".

Earthling the divine fire brings completion.
