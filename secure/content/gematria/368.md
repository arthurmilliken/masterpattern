> fifth.

### [shechin, shakin](/keys/ShChIN) - שחין
> Boil, ulcer, eruption. [Deuteronomy 28:35](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-35.htm): *"The Lord will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles fo your feet to top of your head."* Note that the legs and knees correspond to Aquarius and Capricorn, and to alchemical fermentation (Capricorn, #[830](830)) and dissolution (Aquarius, #[395](395)). In the text the punishment was for disobedience to the Lord.

> Also: [Job 2:7](http://biblehub.com/job/2-7.htm): *"So went Satan froth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown."* Satan (#[359](359), [364](364)) personifies the principle of limitation or Saturn, and Job ("the greatly afflicted one," #[19](19)) typifies the right knowledge which overcomes this limitation. Also: ShChIN (saykayawn) swimmer. One who navigates the "waters" of consciousness. Remember that the waters are also fiery; hence, the boil or eruption. see [1018](1018).

> Godwin gives: "boils"; the 5th of the ten plagues of Egypt. [Exodus 9:9](http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm): (8) *"Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 'Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. (9) It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land."*

### [shabelul](/keys/ShBLVL) - שבלול
> snail (so called from its flowing away). [Psalm 58:9] *"As a snail that melts (into a slime), let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun."* see [332](332), ShBL.
