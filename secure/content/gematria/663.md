> Fabre D'Olivet comments: *"The word KVKB, vulgarly translated star, is composed of the root KVH, which is related to every idea of strength and of virtue, physically as will as morally, and of the mysterious root AVB which develops the idea of the fecundation of the universe. Thus according to the figurative and hieroglyphic sense, the word KVKB signifies not only star, but the virtual and fecundating force of the universe. Therein can be found the germ of many ancient ideas, where relative to astrological science, concerning which it is known that the Egyptians thought highly, or whether relative to the hermetic science... The Samaritan and Chaldaic versions do not differ here from the Hebrew."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp.47-48] Recall that Chokmah is the sphere of the zodiac or stars is the center also of ChIH Chaiah, the Life-force. see [73](73), [23](23).
