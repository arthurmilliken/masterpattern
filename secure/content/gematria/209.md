## 209 - Two Hundred Nine

## Latin

### succus luna et solis (Lt).
> juice (or sap) of the sun and moon. Occurs in the text accompanying a plate on page 13 of Secret Symbols. The commentary tells us that the sap must be fixed before it is transformed into fog or smoke. It says also that the two fogs or smokes are the roots of the hermetic art. "I am the sap which maintains and makes alive everything in nature, and I come from the above into the below. I am the dew of heaven and the oiliness of the Earth. I am the fiery water and the watery fire. Without me nothing can have temporal existence and Life. I am near all things, yes, and through all things, yet unrecognized."
