The Aesch Mezareph [VIII, p.40] says "the husband of Mehetabel ["God benefit", 97] is that Edomite king, and kind of redness, who is called Hadar, glorius; viz. the beauty of the metallic kingdom, which is gold ([Daniel 11:20-29](https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/11-20.htm)). But such gold as may be referred to Tiphareth. For Hadar represetns 209, which number also the Tetragrammaton, multiplied by 8, produces (which is the number of circumcision and Yesod) is the whole word by added as one."

### [Bovar](/keys/BVAR)
> 10th Spirit of Goetia, denmon by day of the 1st decanate of Cancer (according to Aurum Solis, demon of the 1st quinance of Scorpio) President commanding 50 legions. Appears as a centaur which the Sun is in sagittarius. Powers: teaches moral and natural philosophy, the art of logic, and the virtues of all herbs and plants; heals all human distempers; gives good familars. [Godwin's Cabilistic Encyclopidia, p.62] Of the 2nd two letters

> Fabre D'Olivet comments: _"AR. This root... [is] very important... The signs which constitute the one in question here, are those of power and of movement proper. Together they are the symbol of the elementary principle, whatever it may be, and of all which pertains to that element or to nature in general. Hieroglyphically AR was represented by the straight line, and ASh by the circular line. AR, conceived as elementary priciple, indicated direct movement, rectilinear; ASh relative movement, curvilinear, gyratory. AR. That which belongs to the elementary priciple, that which is strong, vigorous, productive."_ ([The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p.299](https://archive.org/details/hebraictongueres00fabriala/page/n319/mode/2up))

> The letters of the demon's name suggest a misuse of the power of concentration, (Beth) applied through false intuition or psychism (Vav) to influence the undisciplined power of spirit (Aleph) into personal application of solar regenerative force (Vav). The 1st decanate of Cancer is ruled by the Moon and has the qualities: receptive, domestic, imitative. The influence of the demon suggest conscious imbalance, resulting in negative aspects of these qualities. In the Tarot minor arcana this decanate is assigned to the 2 of Cups. This represents the operation of Chokmah, sphere of the Zodiac, in Briah the creative world of ideas. When ill-dignified as here, this can incite reverses and losses through parents or the opposite sex; unfortunate changes of residence; fluxuations of mood and unwise decisions. The remedy is to align oneself with the vast, inexhaustible creative potency of the life-power, which is true wisdom, under some limitation.

### succus luna et solis (Lt).
> juice (or sap) of the sun and moon. Occurs in the text accompanying a plate on page 13 of Secret Symbols. The commentary tells us that the sap must be fixed before it is transformed into fog or smoke. It says also that the two fogs or smokes are the roots of the hermetic art. "I am the sap which maintains and makes alive everything in nature, and I come from the above into the below. I am the dew of heaven and the oiliness of the Earth. I am the fiery water and the watery fire. Without me nothing can have temporal existence and Life. I am near all things, yes, and through all things, yet unrecognized."
