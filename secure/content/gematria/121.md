> Fabre D'Olivet comments: *"מט. this root, composed of the sign of exterior and passive action, united to that of resistance, develops all ideas of motion or emotion given to something; vacillation; stirring; a communicated movement especially downward. The Arabic [word] has the same sense. As verb, this root indicates the action of drawing, stretching, extending by pulling. מוט. Action of moving, rousing, budging, stirring, agitating; going, following, happening, arriving, etc."* [[The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p. 389](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/388)]

An anxious inquiring, a search; a turgescence, a boiling; action of boiling, etc."* [[The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p. 306-307](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/n327)]

### [Esiyim](/keys/ASIIM) - אסיים
Essenes. *"The Essenes were a sect of Second Temple Judaism that flourished from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century AD which some scholars claim seceded from the Zadokite priests."* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essenes). Fabre d'Olivet writes:

> the Essenes *"held a median position between the Pharisees, who made every thing give way to the allegorical, and the Sadducees who, by the dryness of their interpretations perverted the dogmas of Moses. They preserved the letter and the material meaning outwardly, but guarded the tradition of the oral law for the secret of the sanctuary. The Essenes, living far from cities, formed particular societies, and in no wise jealous of the sacerdotal charges filled by the Pharisees, or of the civil honors intrigued for by the Sadducees, they applied themselves much to ethics and the study of nature. All that has been written upon the mode of life and the intelligence of this sect has redounded greatly to its credit. Wherever there were Jews, there were Essenes; but it was in Egypt that they were mostly found. ... if it is true, as everyone attests, that Moses has left an oral law, it is among the Essenes that it has ben preserved."* [[The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p39](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/n59)]
