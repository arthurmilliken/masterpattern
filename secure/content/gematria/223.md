### [Kabzeel](/keys/QBTzAL) - קבצאל
> gathering of God, God has gathered. In the Zohar [Prologue 6A-6B], this word is said to represent the concentration of the Limitless Light in the first Sephirah (Kether). [2 Samuel 23:20](http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm): *"And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion like man of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the snow."*

> [Benaiah](/keys/BN.IH), בן יה, Ben Yah, "son of God" is also a metathesis of Binah BINH. [Jehoiada](/keys/IHOIDA) יהעידא ("Jah knoweth") = 100 = Qoph and KP, also כלים vessels; meaning "Jehovah known" [Zohar] "Contains an allusion to wisdom" [Case]: "Because [Benaiah](/keys/BNIHV), בניהו, contains BN, son = 52, and appellation of Tiphareth, combined with IHV = 21 = AHIH, the Kether divine name. 52 + 21 = 73 = [Chokmah](/keys/ChKMH) חכמה, wisdom"

> [Zohar] "Kabzeel, from the highest and hidden grade where 'no eye hath ever seen, etc.'" [Isaiah 64:3](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-3.htm) *"When thou didst terrible things which we looked not. For, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence."* [Zohar] "A grade which contains the whole and which is the focus of the supernal light and from which everything issues." Thus Kabzeel קבצאל is the central point which is called אני [Leviticus 19:30](http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-30.htm). *"Upon which rests the unknown, the most high, the unrevealed one which is IHVH, both being one."* [Zohar 1:p.24]. This point is the palace of holiness in the midst, referred to in Sepher Yetzirah to Tav = the place of God, described in the Clementine Homilies as 'that-which-is-not", or in Hebrew אין, the metathesis of אני. see [61](61), [271](271) (Greek).

> [Leviticus 19:30](http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-30.htm): "Therefore shall ye keep my ordiance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God."
