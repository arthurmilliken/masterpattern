### [shawlach](/keys/ShLCh) - שלח
> to send, to stretch out, extend; to dismiss, drive out; to throw off, undress, flay. [Ecclesiasticus (Wisdom of Sirach) 47:23-24](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ecclesiasticus-47-23_47-24/) *"There was also Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and shewed Ephraim the way of sin: And their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they were driven out of the land."* Jeroboam {IRBOM, #[322](322)) means "the people increase." Nebat is reproduction (Nun) through concentration (Beth) of the serpent power (Teth). Ephraim is connected with Taurus and alchemical congelation ([331](331)).

The same force that is driven out is used to set free from bondage. Note that this word is an metathesis of the two preceding and shows the spiritual fire (Shin) as a goad (Lamed) to receptivity of the one self (Cheth).
