### [Cypros](/greek?word=kupros) (Gr) - Κυπρος
> *Cyprus, the island in the Fama, where brother P.A.L. is said to have "died". To say P.A.L. dies, however, does not mean that this impulse is extinguished, in occult literature and especially in alchemical writings, death means transmutation (Key 13). What is meant here is that the superconscious impulse is transmuted int the special activity of the certain center, indicated by the name Cyprus. Cyprus is the most easterly island of the Mediterranean sea. Its name is the Greek root of the English noun copper, because Cyprus is where the copper mines which supplied the ancient world. Copper is the metal... of Venus, and Cyprus was the fabled birthplace of Aphrodite... In Hebrew Venus is Ashtoreth (1370)... sum of the values of the Hebrew words for Wisdom, Strength and Beauty. Venus is associated with the direction east, the place of dawn the womb of light and associated with the beginning spiritual illumination... The Venus center is a nerve-plexus in man's throat. It is the most easterly island because it is nearest to the original source of power. It is the link between the 4 lower centers in the body, and the 2 higher center in the head. Through the Venus center, an alchemist would say, the sun rises to be joined to the Moon hence there can be no beginning of true development until Brother P.A.L., who represent the metaphysical power of spiritualism, "dies at Cyprus", which means that the superconscious impulse received through the sun center is changed into the awakened functioning of the Venus center [Aleph=bull=throat=Venus]. Observe that the state of consciousness produced by the awakening of this center is predominantly emotional. The desire nature is stirred into intense activity. Little or no progress in practical occultism is made by persons having no stronger motive that intellectual curiosity. The feelings must participate. The inner door, must open, toward the heart, rather than toward the head. This, remember, at the beginning of the work, Later, the same door must swing the other way, to let the force from the heart center rise through the throat to enter and energize the brain. But at first there must be deep and genuine emotion if there is to be any effective action. This is the Great practical lesson of the part of the Fama.* [True and Invisible, page 110-113] see [87](87) (Latin), [111](111) (P.A.L), [434](434), [4](4); [358](358) (note).
