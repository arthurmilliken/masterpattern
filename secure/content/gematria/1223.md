### Azoth - AZΩת
(A+Z+Ω+ת = Azoth = 1 + 22 + 800 + 400 = 1223)

> Azoth was considered to be a universal medication or universal solvent, and was sought for in alchemy[1]. Similar to another alchemical idealized substance, alkahest, azoth was the aim, goal and vision of many alchemical works. Its symbol was the Caduceus. The term, while originally a term for an occult formula sought by alchemists much like the philosopher's stone, became a poetic word for the element mercury. The name is Medieval Latin, an alteration of azoc. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azoth)

> *Begining and end. Alchemical term relating to the first matter, the Quintessential (see 158 Latin), or the 5th essence, akin to the Akasha of Hinduism. The true meaning of the word Azoth is to be discerned in the fact that its first letter may betaken either as Alpha, Aleph or A, its 2nd letter as the final letter of the Latin alphabet, its 3rd letter as the last of the Greek alphabet and the concluding Th, the last Hebrew letter... in short, to arrive at the completion of the Great Work is to pass out of the limitations of time into the freedom of eternity, where past and present and future meet in a timeless now, just as any point on the circumference of a circle is at once beginning and end, Alpha and Omega, Aleph and Tav, A and Z.* [True and Invisible, page 84]. see [1](1), [400](400), [800](800), [801](801), [22](22).

> *"Azoth is a mystical and cabalistic word used principally by the Alchemist of medieval times... in one sense it therefore signifies the beginning and the end, or that which is contained within these limits, otherwise, "The essence of all things." In harmony with this it is used to denote 'the Astral Light' and in Alchemy signifies the philosophical Mercury, the root of all metals, or the divine essence brought own into the operation, which it completes."* [Micheal Whity, The meaning of Azoth, Azoth Magazine, July 1920 page 6]. see [11](11), [414](414).
