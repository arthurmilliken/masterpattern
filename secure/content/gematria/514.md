The last letter of MOMID looks ahead to the path we have yet to consider... it governs the generation of mental images by subconsciousness in response to impulses and suggestions originating in the self-conscious field. Its activity is summed up in the one word, imagination."* [Paul Case: True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (4th), pp.443-446]
