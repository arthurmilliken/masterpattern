> Paul Case: *"The Roman rule is appropriately represented... for iron is the metal of Mars, the war-god chiefly honored by the Romans... The Roman empire mingled itself with the seed of men, but while the Romans were great conquerors, they were not good colonizers. Thus the Roman empires in its later stages is perfectly symbolized by the feet of the image [of clay and iron], in which the iron of Roman miliary rule is mingled with the customs and traditions of the subjugated nations, without overcoming the essential characteristics of the nations"* [Daniel, Master of Magicians]. Note that Pisces rules the feet and is attributed to Qoph. see [100](100), [259](259). The "nations" are the masses of unspecialized body cells in the microcosm.

### [thanatos](/greek?word=thanatos) (Gr) - θάνατος
> death. Omikron writes: *"This word appears to equate the mortal conditions and apothanatos, if such a noun were in use, would signify the quitting to the mortal condition."* The Immortals were the Athanato: those apart from the fate of mortals. The verb apothneskein means literally, to strive to get away from the mortal state (thnesis): Apothanein-to pass from mortality. The word analysis seems to be a synonym for [apo] thanatos. In actual usage, the native Greek world probably not be confused by the dropping of the preposition 'apo'. [Letters from Paulos, p.255]

> James Pryse: *"Now the microcosmic 'universe', the lower self which had been evolved during the generative aeons, has fulfilled its purpose, and is superseded by a new universe, a new cycle of spiritual evolution transcendent in glory."* [Apocalypse Unsealed, p.210] see [446](446), [50](50), [106](106), [700](700).
