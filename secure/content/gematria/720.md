### [Saykel Shalom](/keys/ShKL.ShLM) - שכל שלם
> the Perfect Intelligence, the 8th Path of Wisdom. Shalom means "whole, uninjured, full, complete. The meaning "full" refers to completeness in number, measure and weight. Thus the name of the 8th path indicates a kind of consciousness which brings forms to completion through applying the principles of mathematics to accurate measurement. What performs these functions is the human intellect, personified by Thoth in Egypt, by Nebo in Chaldea, by Hermes among the Greeks, and by Mercury in the Roman pantheon. Related to what, in our time concept is the future view of the Life-power's activities. Sphere of Mercury. The self-conscious process of forming plans to transform desires into realities, as in Key 1, The Magician. see 1431.

> Every advance toward a greater perfection is but the utilization, the unveiling of this primordial treasure. Gedulah, or Chesed, is the Life-power's unfailing beneficence. The root of all future blessings is the Life-powers loving provision for our every need, through our clear patterns.

> *"The adjective translated 'perfect' is the title of the 8th path is שלם [Shalom](/keys/ShLM), in Hebrew. it also means "well, peaceful, happy', and it is the root of the Hebrew proper name שלמה, Shelomoh or Solomon. The three primary doctrines of the grade of Pracitus correspond to the three letters of שלם, and to the Tarot Keys representing these letters, as follows:*

> 1. *Judgement, Key 20 (Shin): Human life, even now, extends beyond the limits of the physical world...*
> 2. *Justice, Key 11 (Lamed): all the activities of the universe are held in equilibrium...*
> 3. *the Hanged Man, Key 12 (Mem): The personal man is never the thinker, the speaker, nor the actor. Any thought any word, any deed is the operation of the sum-total of cosmic forces and laws, taking particular form in time and space, through the instrument of human being (or other vehicle of the cosmic life)...*

> *What the Practicus endeavors to perfect is the mental attitude expressed in these three truths. to achieve this result he must be continually on the watch. Such watchfulness is distinctly an operation of the self-consciousness and therefore properly related to the sphere of mercury. What is aimed at here is the formation of new habits of thought..."* [True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (WeiserBooks), pp.188-189](https://archive.org/details/PaulFosterCase-TheTrueAndInvisibleRosicrucianOrder4thEd-1985/page/n193).

> *"It is the Absolute Intelligence, preparing themselves according to the immutable and perfect law."* [Meditations on the Paths of Wisdom]

> Fabre D'Olivet comments: "KN... this root, wherein the ssimilative sign is united to the root AN, image of all corporeal ircumspection, is related to that which enjoys a central force nergetic enough to become palpable, to form a body, to acquire olidity: it is in general, the base, the point upon which things est.

> The Arabic [word] has not differed form the Hebraic root in its primitive origin; but its development have been different. The intellectual root HVH to be-being, almost entirely lost is Arabic, has been replaced by the physical root KN; so that in the Arabic idiom the word [Arabic word], which should designate only material, corporeal existence, substance in general, signifies being. This substitution of one root for another has had very grave consequences, and has derived more than anything else to estrange Arabic from Hebrew.

> KN that which holds to physical reality, corporeal kind; stability, solidity, consistency; a fixed constituted, naturalized thing: in a restricted sense, a plant: in an abstract sense, it is the adverbial relatives, yes, thus, that then, etc. The Arabic [word], in consequence of the reasons explained above, characterizes the state of that which is, that which exist, or passes into action in nature. This root which, in Arabic, has usurped the place of the primitive root HVH, signifies literally, it existed. It can be remarked that the Samaritan and Chaldaic follow the sense of the Hebraic root, whereas the Syriac and Ethiopic follow that of the Arabic.

> KVN action of constituting, disposing, fixing, grounding; action of strengthening, affirming, confirming; action of conforming, qualifying for a thing, producing according to a certain mode, designating by a name, naturalizing, etc." [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp. 373-374] [Nun = 700] see [70](70).
