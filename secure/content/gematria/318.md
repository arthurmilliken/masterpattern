> ([2](2)x[3](3)x[53](53)). The number of servants in Abram's army when he marched against King Chedorlaomer in the battle of Siddim: ([Genesis 14:14](https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm)): *"And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, **three hundred and eighteen**, and pursued them unto Dan."*

### [Eliezer](/keys/ALIOZR) - אליעזר
> God of help. ([Genesis 15:2](http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm)). Name of Abram's steward. Eliezer came from Damascus, which means "Work" ([444](444)). Furthermore, he is steward of Abram's "House" (BITh), and in [Genesis 14:14](http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm), the number of servants in Abram's House is 318. The Hebrew noun which is translated in the authorized version as "trained servants" really means "Initiates," and christian tradition, preserved in the apocryphal Epistle of Barnabas (chapter 8) asserts that ceremony of initiation included circumcision, "Mark, first the 18, and next the 300." For the numerical letters of 10 and 8 are 14 and these denote Jesus. And because the cross was that by which we were to find grace; therefore he adds, [300](300). In Greek 300 is Tau, which is a cross. ([Apostolic Gnosis, Bond and Lee, p.40](https://archive.org/details/materialsforstud01leatiala/page/40/mode/2up)). see [88](88), [505](505), [4860](4860).
