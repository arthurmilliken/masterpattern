### [Yahweh Tzedeqenu](/keys/IHVH.TzDQNV) - יהוה צדקנו
> "Jehovah (IHVH) our righteousness [Jeremiah 23:6](http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm) *"In the days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called the Lord of righteousness."* Recall that Judah is connected with the sign of Leo = heart or Sun = alchemical digestion. see [30](30). Israel means "he shall rule as God". Righteousness is linked with Chesed, Mercy, the sphere of cosmic memory, or Jupiter. see [1801](1801) (Greek).

---

### [Sihra](/keys/SIHRA) - סיהרא
> the Moon. Chesed is the sphere of the cosmic moon, wherein the waters of memory are gathered. see [87](87).

---

### [kinnor](/keys/KNVR) - כנור
> a cithara; harp, lyre; violin. Connected with the physical body. [Genesis 4:21](https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-21.htm): *"And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle **the harp** and organ"*

	.    "So this thy body is the instrument
	.    whereon may be played the song of life.
	.    Nay, it is more than this;
	.    for on this harp of ten thousand strings,
	.    the wind of the spirit moveth ever,
	.    and soundeth night and day the melodies
	.    and harmonies of the eternal song.
	.    Yet few there be with ears to hear,
	.    for that hearing is too often dulled
	.    by the noisy clamor of the world's illusion."
	.    [Book of Tokens: Epilog - Malkuth]

### [Achodaraon](/keys/AChVDRAVN) - אחודראון
> Lesser angel governing the triplicity by night of Libra. Note that Libra corresponds to the letter Lamed, the ox-goad, whose primary meaning (LMD) is "to teach, instruct." The one teacher is life, helping its creation through recollection. see [74](74), [926](926).

---

### [Ariton](/keys/ARITVN) - אריטון
> Demon king of water and the west. Water indicates receptivity; the west is the direction of manifestation. Note also by adding Heh to ARI, the first three letters of this word, we obtain ARIH lion (#[216](216)). The final three letters, ThVN = [65](65), the value of HS, hush, keep silence. The lion is the animal nature; silence is one way to conserve energy for constructive work. Demon suggest subconscious imbalance, resulting in negative aspects of these qualities. In the Tarot minor arcana this decanate is assigned to the 5 of Wands. This represents the operation of Geburah, sphere of volition or Mars, in Atziluth, the archetypal world of ideas. When ill-aspected, as here, this can indicate cruelty, violence, lust and prodigality. The remedy is to learn to identify personal will with the one will manifest in the cosmic order, and so free oneself from the delusion of separateness. see [926](926).
