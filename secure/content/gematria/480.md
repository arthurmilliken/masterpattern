### [Lilith](/keys/LILITh) - לילית
> Queen of the Night, Queen of Demons and Qlippoth of Malkuth, the queen or physical plane. see [773](773). Godwin gives: Queen of the night, queen of demons, wife of Samael, wife of Asmodai, first wife of Adam; arch-demon corresponding to Yesod.

> According to Davidson, *"In Jewish tradition, where she originated, Lilith is a female demon, enemy of infants, bride of the evil angel Sammael (Satan). She predate Eve, had marital relations with Adam... According to Rabbi Eleazar (The Book of Adam and Eve), Lilith bore Adam every day 100 children. The Zohar (Leviticus 19A) describes Lilith as 'a hot fiery female who first co-habited with man', but, when Eve was created, 'flew to the cities of the sea coast,' where she is 'still trying to ensnare mankind'... In the Cabala she is the demon of Friday and is represented as a naked woman whose body terminates in a serpent's tail... Lilith is in fact drawn from the Lili, female demonic spirits in Mesopotamian demonology, and known Ardat Lili. The Rabbis read Lilith into scripture as the 1st temptress, as Adam's demon wife, and as the mother of Cain.. in Talmudic lore, as also in the Cabala (The Zohar), most demons are mortal, but Lilith and two other notorious female spirits of evil (Naamah and Agrat Bat Mahlat) will 'continue to exist and plague man until the Messianic day, when God will finally extradite uncleanliness and evil from the face of the earth..." Lilith and Sammael are said to have 'emanated from beneath the throne of divine glory, the legs of which were somewhat shaken by their [joint] activity"... Lilith went by a score of names, 17 of which she revealed to Elijah when she was forced to do so by the Old Testament prophet."* [Davidson: Dictionary of Angels, pp.174-175]

> Kenneth Grant adds: *"Lalita (Sanskrit): the sexual aspect of shakti or power. The original symbol of the concept was, not the woman, but the sow, known in ancient Egypt as Rerit. The great sow or sower became the Lalita of the Indian and the Lilith of Chaldean lore, where she appears as the Queen of Night and the prototype of the succubus or sexual vampire."* [Night of Eden, p.269]

### [sepher melakim](/keys/SPR.MLKIM) - ספר מלכים
"Book of Kings". The books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel (I and II) and Kings (I and II). Tradition ascribes these books along with Deuteronomy to the prophet Jeremiah during the period of the Babylonian exile.

This is "Book M.", mentioned in the Fama. While Brother C.R.C. was in Damcar, *"He learned there better the Arabian tongue, so that the year following he translated the **Book M** into good Latin, which he afterwards brought with him."* [[Fama Fraternitatis](https://archive.org/stream/PaulFosterCase-TheTrueAndInvisibleRosicrucianOrder4thEd-1985#page/n17)]

At the time the Fama was written, the only Latin version of the Bible in wide circulation was the Vulgate, translated by St. Jerome. This quote from the Fama Fraternitatis implies that there is another (secret) translation of these books into "good" Latin which utilizes Qabalah Latin Simplex gematria ("Arabian tongue") to illuminate proper names. see [140](140), [53](53), [137](137).
