> According to Fabre D'Olivet *"שם Shem... The sign of relative duration and movement which is connected here, and the sign of exterior action used as final collective sign, composed a root which produces the idea of that which is distinguished exteriorly by its elevation, its splendor, its own dignity. It is, in its most restricted acceptation, the proper name of a thing, the particular designation of a remarkable place, or of a remote time; it is the mark, the sign by which they are recognized; it is the renown, the splendor, the glory which is attached to them. In its broadest acceptation, it is ethereal space, the empyrean, the heavens over God. That one finds designated by the singular word, in Hebrew as well as in ???, in Chaldaic, or in Syraic. Its extremely difficult to choose, ???, so many significations, that which is most consistent with the son of Noah. Nevertheless one can without ???, translate it by the words, the sublime, the splendid, the radiant, etc."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p.170]
