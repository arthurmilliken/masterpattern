### [aur zeraw latzadiq](/keys/AVR.ZRO.LTzDIQ) - אור זרע לצדיק
"Light is sown for the righteous". [Psalm 97:11](https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm): *"Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart."*

> xxx [beginning of text missing] [Zohar I:20] *"The radiance which God produced at the time of the creation illumined the world form one end to the other, but was withdrawn, in order that the sinners of the world might not enjoy it, and it is treasured up for the righteous, i.e. for the zaddik, as it is written 'light is sown for the Zaddik' [[Psalm 97:11](https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm)]; then worlds will be firmly established and all will form a single whole, but until the time when the future world shall emerge this light is hidden and stored up. This light is issued from the darkness which was carved out by the strokes of the most recondite; and similarly from that light which was stored away there was carved out through some hidden process the lower- world darkness in which light resides. This lower darkness is what is called 'night'..."*

> In another passage, the Zohar [IV: 166B, p.75] comments: *"It was this light that the holy one sowed in the Garden of Eden, and through the agency of the righteous, who is the gardener of the garden, where it grew, multiplied, and brought forth fruit which has nourished the world, as it is written: "A light sown to the righteous' [[Psalm 97:11](https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm)] Thus all the world are nourished to repletion by that gardener who is called 'righteous'. Only when Israel is in exile does this light cease. In that time one might think 'the waters fall form the sea, and the flood decays and dries up' [[Job 14:11](https://biblehub.com/job/14-11.htm)], so how can the world be sustained at all? Therefore it says that 'a light is sown' ["a light is sown", אור זרע, may be read "light is a seed"]. That is to say, continually sown. Now from the time when the stream was cut off from the garden, the gardener has ceased to visit it; but the light sows itself, bringing fruit of itself, like a garden which brings forth without being sown."* see [484](484).

[Psalm 110:5](https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm): *"The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath."*
