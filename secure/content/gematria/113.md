## 113 - One Hundred Thirteen (prime)

---

### [Nevi'im](/keys/NBIAIM) - נביאים
Prophets. See [118](118), [1069](1069) (Gr). [Numbers 11:29](https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-29.htm): *"And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were **prophets**, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them!"*

---

### [ehben bokhan](/keys/ABN.BChN) - אבן בחן
> a tried stone [Isaiah 28:16](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm). Reference to the mystical lamb with seven horns [Secret symbols, page 35]. The lamb is כר (CR), and the 7 horns are the personified powers of the brethren who helped C.R. found the Rosicrucian order. see [137](137), [220](220), [314](314), [1483](1483), [1973](1973).

### [ha-bonaim](/keys/HBVNIM) - הבונים
> "the builders" [Psalm 118:22](http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm): *"The stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner."* see [1389](1389) (Greek), [673](673).

---

### [mah-ha-banaiy](/keys/MH-HBNAI) - מה־הבנאי
> what! the builders! see [45](45), [108](108).

---

### [mah-haboneh](/keys/MH-HBVNH) - מה־הבונה
> Power of the Builder. Observe that 113 is the result from [[what](/keys/MH)! [the builders](/keys/HBVNH)!], an interpretation accepted by many modern commentators, and that is equivalent numerically to מכבנא ([knoll](/keys/MKBNA)), which closely approximates the continental form. if to 113 we add [90](90), [79](79), [732](732) and [548](548) the total is 113+1490 = [1603](1603), a primary number whose digits reduce to 10 (26+1496=[1522](1522)). If we take in the above, the final Nun as 700 then it will be 740+79+732+1248 = [2799](2799), and 113 +2799 = [2912](2912) = 23x7x26 or 24x7x13. This seems rather significant especially as 113 may be taken in either the continental or English version. Also [2799](2799) = 33x311 and 311 is the reflection of 113. [311](311) includes among its means איש [a man, husband](/keys/AISh) and רפאל [Raphael](/keys/RPAL), angelic patron of Building and Mercury. see [311](311).

### [ha-neahawbim](/keys/HNAHBIM) - הנאהבים
> the lovers, the beloved. Title of [Key 6](6) ([Zain](/keys/Z)). [2 Samuel 1:23](http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm): *"Saul and Jonathan were lovely [beloved] and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were strong than lions."* (David's lament at news of the death of Saul, and Saul's son Jonathan). from נאה, "comely, becoming, befitting."

---

### [Beulah](/keys/BOVLH) - בעולה
> Beulah, "espoused". [Isaiah 62:4](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm) *"Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah ['my delight is in her', #[192](192)], and thy land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married."* A reference to the New Jerusalem ["Abode of Peace"] of prophecy.

His day, for invocation, is Tuesday. According to Agrippa, heaven has 196 provinces, with 7 supreme angles governing them, of whom Phalec is one.. in white magic, Phaleg is one of the 7 stewards of heaven."* [Davidson: Dictionary of Angels, p. 223-224]
