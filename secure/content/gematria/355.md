### [shawnaw](/keys/ShNH) - שנה
> year; to do again, repeat, to change, alter, to be different; to study; to teach. Suggest the spiraling cycles of emanation and the paths linking the spheres of the Tree of Life. [Genesis 5:3](http://biblehub.com/genesis/5-3.htm): *"And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years [שנה], and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth."*

> This verse is rendered by Fabre D'Olivet: *"And Adam existed three tens and one hundred cycles (of temporal ontological mutation); and he produced according to his assimilating action, in his reflected shadow, and emanated being, and he called his name Sheth (basis and foundation of all things)."*

> He comments: *"שנה, revolving change... The Hellenists, and Saint Jerome following these unreliable masters, have rendered it by eros, "Annus", a year. But they have, as it their custom, restricted what was taken in a broad sense, and applied to a particular revolution, that which was applicable to an universal, ontological revolution. I have already spoken of this word in v. 14. Chapter I. Its root is שן which we have just now seen to be that of number two and containing every idea of mutation, of variation, of temporal mutation, relative to the being which is this object. The Hebraic tongue has several terms for expressing the idea of temporal duration. עוד characterizes the same state continued, an actual duration; as relation, we translate it be still; הדש, carries the idea of a beginning of existence, either in the order of things, or in the order to time: in its most restricted sense, it means a monthly duration: שנה is applied to the transition of this same existence, to a mutation of the being: that is to say, that the being which is its object, is not found at the end of the period which it expresses, at the same point or the same state that it was at its beginning: in the more restricted sense, it is the space of a year: finally, the last of these terms it שנב, which should mean every revolution which replaces the being in its original state. These divers periods, always relative to the being to which they are applied, can mean the most limited duration as well as that whose limits escape human understanding. The numbers one, two and seven take their roots from this.* ([The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p.155-156](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/155/mode/2up))
