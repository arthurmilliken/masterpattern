### [Asher](/keys/AShR) - אשר
> A tribe of Israel, associated with Libra, and alchemical sublimation. [Genesis 49:20](http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-20.htm). Also means: straight, level, prosperous, happy, blessed. Sublimation involves the elevation or exaltation of undesirable natural trends or impulses, by education or conscious effort, in to some more desirable type of behavior or activity. It includes elimination from mental picture of future action every detail not wished to see realized, whatever wastes power. Libra governs the kidneys -- organs of elimination which maintain the chemical balance of the blood. Breath control is also essential to the work of sublimation. See [570](570), [331](331), [95](95), [30](30), [54](54).

> The Zohar (I, page 64) says: *"The Holy name, when inscribed by super-scription, is אשר, the hidden and recondite temple, the source of that which is called ראשית, [Reshith](/keys/RAShITh). The word אשר (i.e. the letters Aleph, Shin, Resh, from the word בראשית [bereshith](/keys/BRAShITh)) is anagramatically ראש, [head](/keys/RASh), the beginning of which issues from בראשית."*
