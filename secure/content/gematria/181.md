The symbol of the outcome of this ripened growth is a boy-cherub-frequently included in the horn of earth's fruit, as depicted in ancient art. he is the divine child of Plutos, or Pan spermia. Compare Pausanias, for say says for this [sculptor, kephisodos] made for the Athenians a Ploutos holding the wand, made of two intertwined serpents, was the sign of union, or of a future bliss."* [Letters from Paulos, p.254]
