### [Chiram](/greek?word=chiram) (Gr) - Χιραμ
> Hiram (from [1 Kings 5:1 (Septuagint)](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lxx/1ki/5/1/s_296001)). Old Testament name associated with Masonry. see [254](254), [273](273), [1351](1351) (Greek), [2270](2270), [634](634), [50](50), [120](120), [54](54), [372](372).

> Hiram Abiff. Name of the central figure in the legend of Freemasonry, connected with the Christos. The pattern of perfect rectitude and the idea of immortality is symbolized here.

> Hiram Abiff was the chief designer and craftsman of the temple of Solomon. Manly Hall comments: *"To the initiated builder the name Chiram Abiff signifies 'my father, the universal spirit, one in essence, three in aspect'. Thus the murdered master is a type of the cosmic martyr-the crucified spirit of good, the dying Godwhose mystery is celebrated throughout the world... To the mystic Christian Mason, Chiram represents the Christ who in three days (degrees) raised the temple of his body from its earthly sepulcher... thus considered Chiram becomes the higher nature of man and the murderers are ignorance, superstition and fear. The indwelling Christ can give expression to himself in this world only through man's thoughts, feelings, and actions... Sufficient similarity exist between the Masonic Chiram and the kundalini of Hindu mysticism to warrant the assumption that Chiram may be considered a symbol also of the spirit fire moving through the sixth ventricle of the spinal column. The pineal gland is the ... eye single, which cannot be opened until Chiram (the spirit fire) is raised through the sacred seals which are called the seven churches in Asia. The legend of Hiram Abiff is based upon the ancient Egyptian mystery ritual of the murder and resurrection of Osiris..."* [Secret Teaching of All Ages: pp.78, 79, 95]
