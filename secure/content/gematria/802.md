### [tebath](/keys/ThBTh) - תבת
> **A:** An ark, as of Noah, in [Genesis 6:14](http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm): *"So make yourself **an ark** of Cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out."*

> Gaskell suggests that this ark is *"a symbol of the casual body as a means for the preservation of the individuality and the qualities of the soul, while lower conditions are swept away... the divine command is given the individuality (Noah) to form a causal-body, and in the higher mental vehicle several compartments for different functions are to be made. And it is to be limited in this nature within and without. 'Pitch' is a symbol of limitation which provides for the distinguishment of truth... The 'ark' does in a measure correspond with the 'cross', in that they both indicate the junction between the higher and lower natures."* [Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths, pp.65-66] see [407](407), where this word is spelled ThBH and 37 (Greek); [432](432).

> Fabre D'Olivet commenting of this word spelled as [407](407) says:

> > *ThBH, a thebah... It appears to be the Samaritan translator who, rendering this word by...., a vessel, was the first to give rise to all the absurd ideas that this error has brought forth. Never has the Hebrew word, ThBH signified a vessel, in the sense of a ship, as it has since been understood; but a vessel in the sense of a thing destined to contain and to preserve another. This word, which is found in all the ancient mythologies, merits particular attention. It has so many significations that it is difficult to assign a definite one. It is, on the one hand, the symbolic name given by the Egyptians to their sacred city, Theba, considered as the shelter, the refuge, the abode of the Gods; that famous city transported into Greece to a straggling village of Beotia, has sufficed to immortalize it. On the other hand, it is a circuit, an orbit, a globe, a land, a coffer, an ark, a world, the solar system, the universe, in fact, that one imagined contained in a sort of vessel called AVB (i.e. the fire of magic, especially black magic]: for I must recall here the fact that the Egyptians did not give chariots to the sun and moon as did the Greeks. But a sort of round vessel. The vessel of Isis was no other than that Theba, that famous ark which we are considering; and it must be stated, the very name of Paris... is only the name of the Thebes of Egypt and of Greece, that of Ancient Syparis, of the Babel of Assyria, translated into the tongue of the Celts. It is the vessel of Isis, (Bar-Isis) that mysterious ark, which, in one way or another carries ever the destines of the world, of which it is the symbol.*

> > *Besides, this word AVB, whose vast meaning could not be exactly rendered by any of those that I know, and which the wisest Egyptians alone were in a position to comprehend, given over to vulgar Hebrew and following the proneness of their own gross ideas, was finally restricted and corrupted to the point of signifying literally the belly; a leather bottle; and figuratively, a magic spirit, a sort of demon to which the Jews attributed the oracles of their sibyls. But there exist in the Hebraic idiom as well as in the neighboring idioms form the same source, a mass of expressions, which starting from the same radical principle, show all its importance.*

> > *It is first its analogue AB, developing the general idea of fructification, of generation, of paternity; then, it is that of will, in ABH; that of love, in AHB: it is all blossoming, in the Syriac... it is every awakening, in the Arabic [word] all immensity, every unknown place, in [Arabic word] every inner and profound sentiment, in [Arabic word] finally, without seeking to link with this root any other signs than the one which enters into the composition of the word ThBCh, it is the action of being moved in oneself, of returning, of retiring into, of withdrawing to oneself through desire, in the three verbs ThVB, ThVBB, and ThAVB: it is even the name of the Universe, in the compound ThBL. One cannot see in all this, either the coffer of the Hellenist [Greek word] of the chest of the Latin translator, "arca".* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp.191-192]

> **B.** An ark, as of Moses, in [Exodus 2:3](http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm): *"And when she could no longer hide him [Moses], she took for herself **an ark** made of Acacia wood, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child into it; and laid it among the reeds by the river's bank."*

> Gaskell suggests that the ark of bulrushes of the babe Moses is *"A symbol of the mental condition of simplicity and aspiration in which the nascent moral nature is brought up.... And when the growing moral nature (Moses) became distinguishable from the emotion-nature (woman) that gave it birth, the emotions separated it off and by craft limited its scope, leaving it in simplicity and solitude to its aspirations (bulrushes, reeds). The ethical beginnings (Moses) could not have endured the complexities of the external warring conditions, of multifarious lower plane activities: and must needs be nurtured in isolation and truth (water), and be related by an affection-the daughter of a ruler of the lower nature."* [Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths, p.65]

> The Zohar [III:11B] comments: *"She took for him an ark of bulrushes: Thereby prefiguring the ark that contained the 'tables of the covenant': and daubed it with slime and with pitch, prefiguring again the ark which was overlaid with and without...an alternative explanation... she guarded him with signs against the power of the fishes that swim in the ocean-that is, the evil spirits- 'wherein are things creeping innumerable [Psalm 104:25] She protected him from such harm by apprecious covering composed of two colors, black and white (grace and might). She laid the child between the hues, in order that he might become familiar with them, and later ascend between them to receive the Torah [Law, i.e. commandments]."* (pp.35, 36)
