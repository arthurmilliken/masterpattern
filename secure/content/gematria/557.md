> [beginning of text missing] ... as it has been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven sprits of God sent forth into all the earth." [James Pryse: The Apocalypse Unsealed, p.119] *"The horns and eyes are the seven noetic powers of action and the seven noetic perceptive faculties... The lamb is a variant of the ram, Aries; and the 'lamb' here is identical with the 'lion of the tribe of Juda' [30], since the sign Leo is the sole domicile of the sun, and Aries is its highest exaltation. Microcosmically, also corresponds to the... 'third eye' and Aries to the... cerebral radiance. This lamb is the incarnated nous, the intellectual sun, which may be re??? are the third Logos-man as he is on earth... Thus the lamb represents the neophyte, whose inner nature is awakening, and who is about to undergo the perfecting, or initiatory ordeals."*

Could this be "Book H" referred to in the Fama? see [345](345), [50](50) (Lt).
