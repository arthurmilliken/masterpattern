> Fabre D'Olivet writes of the root טל as follows: *"The sign of resistance united by contraction to the root AL, symbol of every elevation, composes a root whose object is to express the effect of a thing which raises itself above another thing, covers, veils, or puts it under shelter... That which cast a shadow, that which is projected from above ?? below; that which varies, changes, moves like a shadow: a veil, a garment with which one is covered; a spot which changes color; the dew which forms a veil over plants; an ??? lamb still under the shelter of its mother."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p.358]
