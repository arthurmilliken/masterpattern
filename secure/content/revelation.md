## The Book of Revelation

---

### Chapter 1

#### Prologue ([Daniel 12:1-13](http://biblehub.com/kjv/daniel/12.htm))

([1](http://biblehub.com/text/revelation/1-1.htm)) The [Revelation](1512) of [Jesus Christ](2368), which [God](284) gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant [John](929): ([2](http://biblehub.com/text/revelation/1-2.htm)) Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of [Jesus](688) [Christ](1680), and of all things that he saw. ([3](http://biblehub.com/text/revelation/1-3.htm)) [Blessed](442) is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this [prophecy](1274), and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.

#### John Greets the Seven Churches
([4](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-4.htm)) [John](1119) to the seven [churches](504) which are in [Asia](212): [Grace](911) be unto you, and [peace](181), from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven [Spirits](1726) which are before his throne; ([5](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-5.htm)) And from [Jesus Christ](2368), who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the [dead](1025), and the prince of the [kings](1098) of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, ([6](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-6.htm)) And hath made us kings and [priests](330) unto [God](824) and his [Father](491); to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. ([7](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-7.htm)) Behold, he cometh with [clouds](1440); and every eye shall see him, and they also which [pierced](704) him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, [Amen](99).

([8](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-8.htm)) I am [Alpha](532) and [Omega](800), the beginning and the ending, saith the [Lord](800), which is, and which was, and which is to come, the [Almighty](1822).

#### John's Vision on Patmos

([9](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-9.htm)) I [John](1119), who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of [Jesus](688) [Christ](1680), was in the isle that is called [Patmos](1231), for the word of [God](484), and for the testimony of [Jesus](688) [Christ](1680). ([10](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-10.htm)) I was in the [Spirit](886) on [the Lord's day](/greek?word=tei+kuriakhi+hmerai), and heard behind me a great voice, as of a [trumpet](597), ([11](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-11.htm)) Saying, [I am](873) [Alpha](1) and [Omega](800), the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a [book](174), and send it unto the seven [churches](504) which are in [Asia](222); unto [Ephesus](830), and unto [Smyrna](841), and unto [Pergamos](349), and unto [Thyatira](826), and unto [Sardis](520), and unto [Philadelphia](1146), and unto [Laodicea](201).

([12](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-12.htm)) And I turned to see the [voice](1408) that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven [golden](1501) [candlesticks](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=1291); ([13](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-13.htm)) And in the midst of the seven [candlesticks](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=1940) one like unto the [Son of man](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=2040), clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden [girdle](915). ([14](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-14.htm)) His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his [eyes](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=730) were as a [flame of fire](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=1510); ([15](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-15.htm)) And his [feet](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=359) like unto [fine brass](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=1614), as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of [many waters](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=2615). ([16](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-16.htm)) And he had in his right hand seven [stars](https://www.biblewheel.com//GR/GR_Database.php?Gem_Number=807): and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.

([17](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-17.htm)) And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: ([18](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-18.htm)) I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. ([19](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-19.htm)) Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; ([20](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/revelation/1-20.htm)) The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.
