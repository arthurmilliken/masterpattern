### [Tdedek ve-shalom](/keys/TzDQ.VShLVM.NShQV) - צדק ושלום נשקו
> *"Righteousness and peace have kissed each other"* [Psalm 85:10](http://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm). צדק is the name of the planet Jupiter, whose quality of expression is the 1st letter (Kaph) in Kether. שלום, shalom is completeness, fullness, at the end or limit of a cycle (ת in כתר). כת are therefore "righteousness and peace." Expansion and contraction, complementary opposites are combined in the "Beginning of the Whirling Motion" which originate in Kether. see [860](860), [1892](1892), [194](194), [376](376).
