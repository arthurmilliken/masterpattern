### [Saykel Mogashem](/keys/ShKL.MVGShMf) - שכל מוגשם
> Corporeal or Incarnating Intelligence. The [29th Path](29) of [Qoph](/keys/Q) (see 739). [Mem = 600].

> *The 29th path (Qoph, joining Netzach to Malkuth) is called the Corporeal (Incarnating) Intelligence because it marks out the forms of all bodies which are incorporated under every revolution of the zodiac, and is what constitutes the arrangement and the disposition thereof.*

> From a root [gawsham](/keys/GShM), meaning: to rain violently, as a noun: a hard shower. Key 18 pictures a shower of 18 Yods (10). 10 x 18 = 180, the # of degrees in a semicircle. 180 is a symbol of a "day," or incarnation period of a personality. Because the sun traces a semicircle through the day.

> This path effects all structural transformations. It is the immediate agency of evolution. "Informs" archic meaning: to form, vitalize, make or inspirit.
