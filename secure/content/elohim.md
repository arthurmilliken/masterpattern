> Creative name attributed to Binah. The "Gods" or 7 spirits of God, the order of angels of Netzach. Refers particularly to Binah as being Amah [AMA], the Dark Sterile Mother." The power which brings actual things into manifestation in the world of name and form. The masculine plural of a feminine singular. One could say that Elohim is a "plural of majesty." א: Rauch (Ether), ל: Libra (Air), ה: Aries (Fire), י: Virgo (Earth), ם: Neptune (Water). see [42](42).

> Other meanings: god, Deity, Angels, judge, ruler. In [Daniel 2:44](http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm), it is written [Eloah Shemiah](387), **אלה שמיא**, "God of Heaven". see [387](387).

> According to Fabre D'Olivet:

> > *"אלהים AElohim.... This is the plural of the word אלה, the name given to the supreme being by the Hebrews and the Chaldeans, and being itself derived from the root אל, which depicts elevation, strength, and expansive power; signifying in a universal sense God. It is a very singular observation that the last word applied to the Most High, is however, in its abstract sense only the relative pronoun he employed in an absolute manner. Nearly all of the Asiatic peoples have used the bold metaphor. הוא (Hoa), that is to say, HE is the Hebrew, Chaladic, Syriac, Ethopic and Arabic, one of the sacred names of the divinity; it is evident that the Persian word Goda, God which is found in all the tongues of the North, is derived also from the absolute pronoun [arabic], HIM-self. It is known that he Greek philosophers and Plato particularly, designated the intelligent cause of the universe in no other way than by the absolute pronoun ρο Αυρο.*

> > *"However that may be, the Hebraic name Elohim has been obviously composed of the pronoun אל and absolute verb, הוה, to be being... It is from the inmost root of this verb that the divine name יה [Yah](/keys/IH), is founded, the literal meaning of which is Absolute-Life. The verb itself, united to pronoun אל, produces אלוה, [Eloah](/keys/ALVH), That-He-who-is, the plural of which Aelohim, signifies exactly HE-they-who-are: The Being of Beings.*

> > *"The Samaritan says Alah, whose root אל is found still in the Arabic Allah, and in the Syariac Aeloha. The Chaladic alone depicts from this root and translates ייי [Iaii](/keys/III), the Eternity of Eternities, which is also applied to the Ineffable Name of God, יהוה...also of the words שמים, The Heavens, and ארץ, the earth."* [[Hebrew Tongue Restored (Cosmogony of Moses) p. 28](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/28)]

> F.J. Mayers adds:

> > *"In the first place it is a plural name. There is a singular form of the name: Eloha, i.e. god (small g ). Elohim, therefore literally means Gods ...although it is clearly a plural name, it is invariably used with the singular verb; i.e. it issued grammatically as if it were singular. The significance of this is that although Elohim denotes, like the Gods of the nations, the various powers, attributes, qualities, and activities of the supreme being, they are all conceived of as a unity; they all work together as one; they express one will, one purpose, one harmony; their activities are the manifestation of the eternal One, the absolute.*

> > *"One might, therefore, explain the name Elohim as 'He the Gods' or 'The unity of Gods', or 'The activities of the Eternal One'. i.e. God expressing and revealing himself outwardly in creative activity. How completely this harmonizes with the New Testament: 'In (the) Beginning was the word and the word was with (literally in) God, and the word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that is made', etc.*

> > *Elohim was the creative aspect of God; he was the creator and maker of all things. So was the word. Elohim was the revealer of the Eternal One. So was the Word ... He hath declared him. Elohim was the outward expression of God -- the divine image or likeness -- which was to be formed ultimately, as we shall see later, in universal man. So was the word. The two names express the same idea, one in Hebrew idiom, and the other in Greek idiom. Each is, in the language of theology, the second person of the divine trinity. But it will be noticed that the two names belong to different ages, and correspond to different stages in human evolution. The earlier name Elohim corresponds to an age in which man was still dominantly an instinctive being, far from being fully self-conscious."* [[The Unknown God, pp. 14-15](http://www.organelle.org/as/aschap2.htm)]

> Cario Suares says that: *"Elohim has ... been explained as being the process through which Aleph becomes Yod and resurrects from that material metamorphosis. Life in its oneness moves up and down, down and up, from infinite to finite, and from duration to timelessness."* [The Cipher of Genesis, p. 87]

> The Zohar [I:15B] Comments: *"When, however it [the house, Beth] was sown with seed to make it habitable, it was called Elohim, hidden and mysterious. The Zohar was hidden and withdrawn so long as the building was within and yet to bring forth and the house was extended only so far as to find room for the holy seed. Before it had conceived and had extended sufficiency to be habitable, it was not called Elohim, but all was still included in the term [Bereshith](/keys/BRAShITh) [[913](913)]. After it had acquired the name Elohim, it brought forth offspring from the seed that had been implanted in it."* (p. 64)
