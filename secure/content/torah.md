## [Torah](/keys/ThVRH)

[Torah](/keys/ThVRH), תורה, means *"the law; instruction; teaching; the law given through Moses; custom; manner; definition; designation; theory."* It specificially refers to the first five books of the Old Testament and which are traditionally attributed to Moses.

1. Read the first and last verses of the Torah ([Genesis 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%201%3A1&version=ESV) and [Deuteronomy 34:10-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deuteronomy%2034%3A10-12&version=ESV)). What does this tell us about the nature of the law? About the relationship between the lawgivers like Moses and Elohim? Do the verses contain any references to the Tarot Keys above? How does creativity produce law, instruction, and theory? If these questions spark a discussion that stays on subject and takes up the rest of the session, so be it. Go on to the following questions at the next meeting.

2. Reckon the gematria value of [Torah](/keys/ThVRH), תורה. It should equal the value of these words and phrases: *[chegreth](/keys/ChGRTh)*, חגרת: armor, to gird for battle; and *[gimelut hasidim](/keys/GMILVTh.ChSDIM)*, גמילות חסדים; acts of loving kindness. How can armor and acts of loving kindness have anything to do with each other, let alone Torah?

3. The Etymological Dictionary says *"In various languages, the word for law is derived from bases meaning place and set down or fixed."* What is fixed in the Tarot Keys which spell [Torah](/keys/ThVRH), תורה? What places are depicted? How does this help us understand the inner nature of law?

4. Read the Epilogos, page 197 of *The Book of Tokens.* Now read the first section of the Meditation on Tav and the commentary on that section. How can [Torah](/keys/ThVRH), תורה, be both fixed and fluid? Eternal and changeable? Customary and revolutionary?

5. Consider the Tarot Keys [21](21), [5](5), [19](19) and [4](4) as a sequence which produces an instruction or teaching. What is being taught? Are there any rules implied? Are rules the same as laws?

6. Everyone has run up against the law to one degree or another. Without being specific as to the circumstances, did you learn anything? Who taught you? Was the law just? Was it inflexible?
