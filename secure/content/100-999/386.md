### [Joshua](/keys/IShVO) - ישוע
> Jesus. Aramaic spelling of the name of the great Qabalistic Master.

> *"The short form of "Joshua"...shows Shin, the letter of Fire, combined with Yod, Vav and Ayin, the three letters that are assigned in the Sepher Yetzirah to the earth signs, Virgo, Taurus, and Capricorn, respectively. The name Jesus is the number 386, or 300 and 86. [300](300) is Shin (Fire), [86](86) is AHIH ADNI, a name of God, asserting the identity of Kether and Malkuth; ALHIM; and KVS, to preserve, to conceal; cup, goblet, receptaculum, hence pudenum mulibre, and pelican, a bird used in Rosicrucian symbology, so called on account of its throat resembling a cup or bag. The name AHIH ADNI, which asserts the identity of Kether and Malkuth is the secret of the saying 'I and the Father are one." In this connection remember that the Holy Ghost came as fire, and that KVS, in all its meanings suggests the concealment, virgin birth, and preservation of the fire through the feminine principle."* [Paul Case of D.D. Bryant's Philosopher's Stone, VI, 7 + 8]. see [300](300), [86](86), [326](326), [67](67) Latin.

> [From Paul Case's notebook, From Day to Day, March 12, 1916]:

> > *"Jesus is IShVO Jehovah is IHVH. Thus Jesus and Jehovah, in Hebrew are identical in respect to the first and third letters, but different in respect to the 2nd and 4th. A Shin takes the place of the first Heh, and a Ayin of the second Heh. Now Shin corresponds to the Perpetual Intelligence, knowledge of perpetuity, changeless consciousness of the real nature of the Ego, and it is the liberating consciousness of personal immorality, that this recognition is the dominant characteristic of Jesus teaching and personal consciousness. In the Tarot Shin corresponds to Judgement, a picture of resurrection with which the name of Jesus is inseparably identified. Thus the substitution of Shin for Heh in Jesus name is the substitution of Liberation for rulership. Jehovah is the ruler (For Heh is the Emperor) and his self-consciousness is that of the Constituting Intelligence. Jesus is the liberator, and his self-consciousness centers upon the idea of releasing men from bondage and death. The final letter of Jesus name is Ayin. In the Kabalah this is Renovating Intelligence, the knowledge that preserves and renews the personal existence. This letters is associated with the Devil, because the first step towards liberation is to recognize what evil really is, so that we can attribute to it absolutely no power to determine the course of our lives. The story of Jesus temptation is a clue to this Jesus did not teach because he had to overcome the Devil. And his way of doing so was the command: 'Get thee behind me Satan! Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God.' When we realize that God is the principle of our lives, all evil is recognized as subordinate and without power. To fear the devil is to worship him. Therefore the Lord's prayer asks God not to lead us into temptation instead of pensioning him to allow us to be tempted by Satan. Jesus, according to Cabalistic attributions of the letters, is consciousness of the Divine Will (Intelligence of Will) reflected in the realization that human personality is essentially immortal (Perpetual Intelligence, "My word shall not pass away."), and these two modes of consciousness are combined in the knowledge or Wisdom destined to Triumph over all error and failure (Vav, Triumphant and Eternal Intelligence) which is the true catholic church, having for its foundation Jesus' personal triumph over the Devil, and of the subordination of matter to thought, which is destined to make all things new (Renovating Intelligence). If we know the will of God (Yod) if we, by daily meditation, become habitually conscious of personal immorality (Shin); if we rely upon the ever-victorious and eternal wisdom within for guidance (Vav), if we fear no evil, and see no evil, and are conscious of our power to make all things new (Ayin), we have in us the mind which was in Christ Jesus. The sum of the letters in Jesus name is 386. Articulated this is 300, 80, 6, or Shin, Peh, Vav. Consciousness if immorality (Shin) overthrows the structure of false science and common-sense (Peh), and makes us rely wholly on the guidance of the indwelling spirit (Vav). by reduction 386 is 17. Articulated this is 10, 7 or Yod and Zain. Consciousness of divine will and of our relation to it (Yod) is expressed in the harmonious relationship of the objective and subjective minds to each other, and to the supreme spirit, and this is a consciousness that enables us to make a right deposition of all our talents, powers and possession (Disposing Intelligence, Zain). By reduction 17 is 8, the same number that represent the final reduction of the letter values of IHVH. Thus the name Jehovah and the name Jesus are represented by the same root-idea. Thus the I AM, Jesus is the recognition of the identity of the personal self with the universal I AM. Both names imply knowledge of the dwelling place of the supreme spirit (Intelligence of House of Influence). Jehovah is the I AM saying: 'My temple is man, and my knowledge is the hearts of men.' Jesus is man saying 'I am the temple of God; God and I are essentially One, He rules in my heart.' The same truth is revealed in both names from opposites points of view.*

> > *The sum of the two names is 412. Articulated, this is 400, 10, 2 or Tav, Yod, Beth; Administrative Intelligence, Intelligence of Will, Intelligence of Transparency; the World, the Hermit, the Magician. By analogy 412 is the number of the Holy Ghost; since it proceeds from 26 (the Father) and the Son (386). Now the Hebrew word for Spirit is Rauch, spelled RVCh, so that its numerical value is the sum of 200, 6 and 8. or 214. Note that 214 is 412 reversed. The same figures, then that enter into the number produced by the addition of the names of the father and son, which by analogy as the product of the numerical equivalent of the names of father and son, should be a number corresponding to spirit, are found in the number of the word, Rauch. The reduction is 7, the number of Zain, and the Holy Ghost is therefore seen to be the Disposing Intelligence, represented in Tarot by the Lovers. Now the sum of the reductions of three names is 8+8+7 or 23. Articulated, this is 20, 3 or Kaph and Gimel (Intelligence of Conciliation and Uniting Intelligence): Wheel and High Priestess. The Trinity, then is that which expresses itself in the Wisdom that reconciles all opposites, and the wisdom that unites man and God. The reduction of 23 is 5 or Heh: Constituting Intelligence or the Emperor. The Emperor, then is the symbol of trinity, regarding as the supreme wisdom constituting all the conditions of existence.*

> > *386 - 26 = 360. This significant number is that which added to the number of Jehovah, produces Jesus. It is the number of the circumference, and the son is the circumference having the father for its center. Articulated 360 is 300, 60 or Shin and Samekh. Perpetual Intelligence and Intelligence of Probation or Trial. Jesus is the I AM, consciousness of immorality, and demonstrates that immorality by actual test or trial. Reduced to 360 is 9 or Teth. Intelligence of the Secret. Jesus is the I AM or God's knowledge that he dwells in the temple of man, expressed as consciousness of the Great Arcanum, that all the forces of nature are subject to the subjective mind of man when that reflects the I AM. This, as we see is the central doctrine of Jesus teachings."*
