### [Yehonathan](/keys/IHVNThN) - יהונתן
> Jonathan. "God is the Giver." Beloved and loyal friend of David and son of Saul in the Biblical Allegory ([1 Samuel 14:6](http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-6.htm)): *"and Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armor, come, and let us go over unto the Garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the Lord will work for us: For there is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few."*

> Because 521 reduces to 8, Jonathan is a symbol of alchemical Mercury. D.D. Bryant: *"Take particular note of Jonathan's love for this represents the undying affinity that Mercury has for Salt. 'He loved him as he loved his own soul, (salt)'... All these various obscuratons, where David goes secretly to meet Jonathan, or flees to mountains and caves, pursued by Saul, are illustrative of what goes on in the Vase of Art... in his lamentation over the deaths of Saul and Jonathan, David plainly shows the mythic alchemical nature of both, when he sings, Saul and Jonathan were lovely and sweet in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: 'They were swifter, that eagles and stronger than lions'..."* [D.D. Bryant, The Philosopher's Stone, IX]. see [14](14), [24](24). Note that lion = Teth and eagle = Nun.
