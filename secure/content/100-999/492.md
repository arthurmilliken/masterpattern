### [zibeth](/keys/TzBTh) - צבת
> handful. Name of the stone of the Philosophers, which Lamech says contains *"the first elements, and the final colors of minerals, or spirit, soul, and body, joined into one."* צבת refers to the letter Yod (Hand), the sign of Virgo and [Key 9](9). The Virgo region transmutes an ordinary human being into an adept. see [80](80), [112](112).

> the king's daughter. [Psalm 45:13](http://biblehub.com//.htm): *"The king's daughter is all glorious within (the palace): her clothing is of wrought gold."* The king is the Ego in Tiphareth: his daughter is Kallah, the Qabalistic bride or Malkuth. The glory is the divine radiance; the temple is the inner sanctum. "Gold" refers to the solar force. In alchemy, when the inner glory shines as gold, the great work is completed. see [972](972), [3101](3101) (Greek).
