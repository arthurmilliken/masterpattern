### [mishpatiham](/keys/MShPTIHM) - משפטיהם
> their judgements; their laws. Refers to [Shin](/keys/Sh), the [31st Path](31). The "revolutions of the zodiac" influenced by this path are the cycles of successive incarnation. The form of "their judgements" is a veiled reference to the completion of the incarnation cycle by the resurrection from what Saint Paul calls *"The body of this death"* [Romans 7:24](http://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm). This is the "natural body", the body of sin, dominated by Nephesh, the vital soul and not yet perfected by the Ego. see [814](814), [464](464).

### [le-tohu ve-hebel](/keys/LThHV.VHBL) - לתהו והבל
> for naught and in vain. [Isaiah 49:4](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm): *"Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught and in vain: yet surely my judgement is with the Lord, and my work with my God."* What man proposes - [Ayin](/keys/O), [Key 15](15) - God disposes  - [Key 6](6) and [Beth](/keys/B), [Key 1](1). Beth + Ayin = [abe](/keys/OB), עב. see [72](72).

---

### [eytheid](/keys/OThID) - עתיד
> ready, prepared; future. future time to come [Sepher Yetzerah 1:2] Shin is located on the pillar of severity, attributed to the future (feminine). The masculine pillar of mercy is equated with the past.

---

### [qav la-qav qav la-qav](/keys/QV.LQV.QV.LQV) - קו לקו קו לקו
> line upon line, line upon line or line by line, line by line. [Isaiah 28:10](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-10.htm): *"To whom shall one teach [knowledge](/keys/DOTh)?.. [28:13](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-13.htm): For it is precept by precept, precept by precept, line by line, line by line."* see [474](474). Resurrection is a step-by-step process.

### [Hetzar-Enon](/keys/ChTzR-OINVN) - חצר עינון
> Hazar-Enan, "enclosure of the fountains". [Numbers 34:9](http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-9.htm) "...And the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-Enan..." This was a point of departure on the ideal north-east border of Canaan near Dan. see [1134](1134), [54](54), [190](190), [993](993). Has alchemical significance. (Ayin = fountain). see [830](830).

### [aur zerao](/keys/AVR.ZRO) - אור זרע
> light is seed. The Zohar [IV 167A, B p.77] Comments: *"...there is first light, then water, then is a firmament formed in the midst of the waters. Similar is the formation of man at his birth. First he is 'seed' which is light; because it carries light to all the organs of the body. That 'seed' which is light sheds itself abroad and becomes 'water', which in its moisture penetrates to all parts of the body; in which body, when it has taken shape, the diffusion of water is solidified and is called 'firmament'"* see [718](718), "a light sown to the righteous" note, [207](207), [277](277).

### [venokachat](VNKChTh) - ונכחת
Thus she was vindicated. [Genesis 20:16](https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm): *"And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved."*
