## 407 - Four Hundred Seven
> ([11](11)x[37](37))

### [aroor](/keys/ARVR) - ארור
> cursed be. [Genesis 9:25](http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-25.htm). The "curse" of laborserving fellow men is really a blessing for those who understand man's real place in the order of nature.

### [Tebah](/keys/ThBH) - תבה
> Ark (Noah's). This understanding is also an ark of salvation. Jesus said "He that is greatest among you shall be your servant." see [971](971), [1844](1844), [1988](1988), [888](888), [58](58), [936](936).

> [Exodus 2:3](http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-3.htm): *"And when she could no longer hide him [Moses], she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid in on the stones by the riverbank..."* [5](http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-5.htm): *"And the daughter of the Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the rivers; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the stones, she sent her maidens to fetch it."*

> Inman says it is also the name given to the ark in which Noah sailed, signifying "a chest", "a ship" and "a sarcophagus". From it Thebes is supposed to have taken its name. The root, he says, seems to be תבה, [tabah](/keys/ThBH), "to be bellied, or hollow out."

### [aydon Kawl ha-aretz](/keys/ADVN.KL-HARTz) - אדון כל הארץ
> "Lord of all the earth." [Psalm 97:5](http://biblehub.com/psalms/97-5.htm): *"The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth."*

> [Joshua 3:13](http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm): *"And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priest that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down form above and they shall stand upon an heap."* see [271](271), [283](283), [690](690), [2208](2208) (Greek), [433](433).

### [shemen tob](/keys/ShMN.TVB) - שמן טוב 
> "the precious oil". [Psalm 133:2](http://biblehub.com/psalms/133-2.htm): (Unity) *"It is like the precious ointment (oil) upon the head, that ran down upon the bread even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments."* [Note: Aaron means "lofty" and suggest Kether, the crown; Jordan (above) means 'descending" or "that which flows down". see [256](256), [264](264).

> Thomas Troward:

> > [Psalm 122](http://biblehub.com/psalms/122.htm). Note the reference to 'the unit' (unity). Conscious dwelling in this is like the precious ointment, viz. "Rubbing in the anointing which teaches all things"

> > [1 John 2:20](http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm): *"But ye have an unction from the holy one, and ye know all things ... [27](http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm) but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him."* Note the idea of this anointing descending-first at the top of the head ideal brain and then downwards -- similarly on Zion.

> > What the Lord commands for us is life for evermore. C.F. [Psalm 68:28](http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm): *"Thy God as commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou has wrought for us."*

> > But see also [Romans 6:23](http://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm): *"For his wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."* see [412](412), [432](432).

> Paul Case comments: *"The precious ointment, בית = [412](412) = שמן הטוב, and the dwelling together of brethren, as a family, or בית is suggested. But it must be remembered also the בית mens capacity, or power of containing or receiving, and in things of the mind this is mental receptivity, the sine qua non of temperament which fits one to be a Qabalist. In the Idra Zuta Qadisha it is said (verse 677) that the beard referred to in Psalm 133 is connected with the influence form the concealed ancient one, descending through the beard of Microprosopus. Note also that טוב refers to day = אור.*

> [Genesis 1:4 & 5](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-4.htm): "And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness, ([5](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm)) and God called the light day, and the darkness he called night..." The descending 'oil', = מזלא = the power descending through the magician in [Key 1](1) to אימא. see [78](78).

### [aoth](/keys/AVTh) - אות
> sign, token, mark, symbol, emblem. The "oil" is a sign of God's blessing, marked upon each forehead of those who have prepared themselves to receive it. Also: Omen, portent; military ensign; letter of the alphabet. see [823](823).

## Greek:

### [heh kleronomia](/greek?word=h+klhronomia) (Gr) - η κληρονομία
> "The inheritance". [Isaiah 58:14](http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-14.htm). *"Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the High places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage (i.e. inheritance) of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."*

> Paul Case says: *"'The heritage', which is the number 407 or [11](11)x[37](37), was applied by Gnostic Christians to Jesus Christ and the traditional wisdom transmitted orally which the Hebrews call Qabalah."* [True and Invisible (4th) 68-69]. see [700](700), [1271](1271) Greek.
