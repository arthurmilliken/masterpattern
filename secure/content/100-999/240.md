## 240 - Two Hundred Forty
3x5x16

### [C.R.C.](/keys/KRK) - כרך
> the initials of the brother who founded the Rosicrucian order. see [340](340), [220](220), [320](320).

Brother C.R.C. can be assumed to be *Ipsissimus* in the Rosicrucian Order. This is evident by the abundant references to Kether in the gematria of the number 240.

### [Ram](/keys/RM) - רם
> the high one, lofty, elevated, exacted. Applied to the spirit of C.R., at the beginning of the story. The same word also refers to Kether, the uppermost point of the Tree of Life. It might also be applied to the upper end of the hypotenuse of the Pythagorean triangle, which is the highest point of that symbol. Furthermore, the same word is a component part of the name **חורם**, [Khurum](/keys/ChVRM) or [Hiram](254), which combines or coalesces the two words **חור**, [Khoor](/keys/ChVR), "white" ([214](214)) (applied also to the Egyptian Khoor, Horus, as God of Light) and **רם**, [Ram](/keys/RM), "high". Thus [C.R.C.](/keys/KRK) is that height at which is also termed the white head by the Qabalist, or Kether, the Crown. *[True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order, p59]*

"Ram" is also a reference to the sign Aries, symbolized by the Ram.

### [Kikkar](/keys/KKR) - ככר
> a circle, district, surroundings. From an Asyriac root meaning "to surround", wich is spelled KRK. As meaning: "a circle," it is closely related in meaning to Kether, the Crown, because Kether is derived from a Hebrew root also meaning "to surround" (620). A crown in its simplest form is a metal circlet surrounding the head of a ruler. Thus the primary meaning of Kikkar is actually related in Hebrew to the word chosen by Qabalists as a name of the first sephirah *[True and Invisible, p. 59]* see [220](220). A symbol of the one reality. also: a talent (weight = 3000 shekels); round loaf of bread, cake; round weight.
