###/keys/RAVBN Reuben
> Tribe of Reuben. "see, a son". Pisces (Godwin says
Aquarius). The ensign of the Tribe of Reuben, according to the
Talmud, bore the symbol of a mandrake, in allusion to the story
in Genesis 30:15,15. mandrakes were reputed to be aphrodisiac,
and thus they relate to the very basis of incarnation. Moreover,
they are plants sacred to the Semitic goddess corresponding to
Aphrodite, or Venus. here is a connection between the Tribe of
Reuben and the sign Pisces, because Venus is exalted in Pisces.
Also assigned to alchemical multiplication, the 12th and last
stage of the Great Work. Reuben mean: "see, a son."

> Multiplication is the act or process of increasing in number or
quantity. Here the alchemist augments his elixir by repeated, or
iterated fermentation. The whole body is tinged with the
consciousness of the Stone. Through the Corporeal Intelligence a
body is built suitable to the Life-power's expression in any
environment. Subconsciousness is the active agency of the process
during the sleep of the body, and the principle changes occur in
the bloodstream, the endocrines and the interior stars. Then the
adept can, by mental imagery alone, utilize currents of the
universal energy through his body, to heal and to effect other
changes in his environment. This leads to projection, the ability
to change personality, physically, mentally and morally, and to
turn or transmute base metals, "the refuse of the earth" into
Gold and Silver. see 7, 54, 95, 30, 100, 162, 395, 466, 570, 501,
331, 739, 830.

###/keys/ADNI TzDK Adoni-tzedek
> righteous Lord. Old Testament king of
Jerusalem [Joshua 10:3]. see 186, 389, 57.

###/keys/TMIR tawmir
> hidden, mysterious, secret.

###/keys/IHVH ZKRV Tetragrammaton Zikero
> "The Lord is his memorial".
[Hosea 12:5]. ZKR means: memory, resemblance; memorial. ZKR with
different vowel points means "male."

###/keys/NTR nawtar
> to keep or guard; to bear grudges. "Keeper" in
[Canticles 1:5] "Do not look at me because I have dark skin,
because the sun has tanned me; my mother's sons contended with
me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard
I have not kept. In [Nahum 1:2] "God is zealous, and the Lord is
avenging; the Lord is avenging and is furious; the Lord will take
vengeance on his adversaries, and he keeps wrath for his
enemies." Mathers in [Sepher Sephiroth, p.30] also gives: nitre.
According to the Oxford dictionary nitre is potassium nitrate or
saltpeter, and ingredient in gunpowder, other wise called natron.
In earlier times it was supposed bo the an nitrous element in the
air or in plants. Written NThR in [Jeremiah 2:22] "Although you
wash yourself with soda, and use an abundance of soap, the stain
of your guilt is still before me, declares the sovereign Lord."
see 650. (this may be a variant spelling).

###/keys/LHT.HChRB lahat ha-khereb
> The flaming sword [Genesis 3:24].
Understood to be a symbol for the holy influence (Mezla, 78),
descending from sephirah to sephirah through the Tree of Life. It
has the same basic meaning as the flash of lighting of Key 16.
Note that LHTh = 44 = DM (blood). HChRB = 215 = AVRCh (a narrow
way) = ZRCh (to irradiate, to rise [as the sun]). The magical
force is in the blood. It is called the flaming sword in the
story of the fall of man, because that story refers to the
descent of consciousness from higher and inner planes to the
physical. The sword "turns every way" because it is the fire
force in the blood-stream, circulating through our bodies, and
therefore turning every direction. It keeps us out of Eden, for
the time being, so that we may gain knowledge of the physical
plane. Yet this same force in our blood is what we must learn to
use in order to overcome the delusions which cause all our
difficulties. Lawhat, (flaming) means also magical, or the force
of enchantment.

###/keys/GRVN gawrom
> throat; neck. [Mathers, Sepher Sephiroth, p.30].
Site of the Venus center. In [Isaiah 3:16] the Lord says, "The
woman of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched neck,
flirting with their eyes, tripping along with minking steps, with
ornaments jingling on their ankles."

### heh onnoia (Gr)
> The faculty of thinking; thought, idea. Olomai
