### [hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepuchrum feci](/latin?word=hoc+universi+compendium+unius+mihi+sepuchrum+feci) (Lt)
> *"I have made this sepulcher as a single compendium of the universe."* Inscription engraved on a circular altar, covered with a plate of Brass (copper), found in the tomb of vault of brother C.R. in the Rosicrucian allegory (Fama).

> *"Here is a direct statement that the symbolism of the vault is cosmic-both macrocosmic and microcosmic. It links the vault with the other great sepulcher, the pyramid, which is also a single compendium of the universe, and with Solomon's temple, and Noah's ark. The inscription is on a circular altar, for the circle is the fundamental symbol of cosmic perfection."* [PFC, True and Invisible (4th), page 201]. see [87](87), [122](122), [76](76), [150](150) Latin, [106](106), [37](37), [23](23), [24](24).
