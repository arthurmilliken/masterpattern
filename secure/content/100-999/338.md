### [shawlach](/keys/ShLCh) - שלח
> to send, to stretch out, extend; to dismiss, drive out; to throw off, undress, flay. [Ecclesiasties 48:18](http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/48-18.htm) *"There was also Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, and showed Ephraim the way of sin: and their sins were multiplied exceedingly, that they were divine out of the land."* Jeroboam {IRBOM, #[322](322)) means "the people increase." Nebat is reproduction (Nun) through concentration (Beth) of the serpent power (Teth). Ephraim is connected with Taurus and alchemical congelation ([331](331)).

> Also: means *"The ShLCh (shilach) to send away, send off; to send out; to let go, let loose, set free; to stretch out, dismiss; to divorce."* The same force that is driven out is used to set free from bondage. Note that this word is an metathesis of the two preceding and shows the spiritual fire (Shin) as a goad (Lamed) to receptivity of the one self (Cheth).

> ShLCh shelaw. dart, missile, weapon, sword; sprout, slip, shoot; extension, space (projective aspect of the life-power); skin, hide; pressed olive; SLCh (shiloah). Shiloam, foundation near Jerusalem; ShLCh (shalawkh). worker in hides, tanner. see [784](784). Root of [Methushelach](/keys/MThVShLCh), *"When he dies, a dart."*

> Also ShLH Shelah, a son of Judah, in [Genesis 38:5](http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-5.htm), and ancestor of the Shelanites: *"She (Shua) gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah; it was at Kezib that she gave birth to him."*

Also Salah, Grandson of [Shem](/keys/ShM). "to send". see [739](739). [Genesis 10:24](https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-24.htm): *"And Arphaxad begat **Salah**; and Salah begat Eber."*

### [lebush](/keys/LBVSh) - לבוש
> garment, covering, clothing, fig. marriage. [Daniel 12:6,7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+12%3A6-7&version=AKJV;WLC) *"And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, how long shall it be to the end of the wonders? And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by him that liveth forever, that is shall be for a time, times and a half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of an holy people, all these things shall be finished."*

In [Hosea 5:14](http://biblehub.com/hosea/5-14.htm): *"For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him."* And in [Psalm 9:13](http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm): *"Thou shall tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample under feet."* see [211](211), [310](310), [340](340), [43](43), [460](460), [1702](1702).
