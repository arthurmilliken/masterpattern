AILTh AHBIM ayeleth ahabim. cerva amorum. a loving doe. [Proverbs
5:19] "A loving doe, a graceful dear-may her breasts satisfy you
always, may you ever be captivated by her loved." Rosenroth in
[K.D.L.C.K. p.77] links this phrase to Malkuth when the glorious
horns of Hod are placed above it.
Greek
πε αμo Peregamos. A celebrated city of Asia minor, famous for
its library. Connected as on of the 7 churches or congregations
of Asia (OShIH, the physical plane) with inner planetary center
of Jupiter. Spelled πε αμ (1029) in [Revelation 2:12] "And by
the messenger of the congregation in Pergamos write: "These
things says the who has the sharp two-edged broad sword; (13) I
know here thou dwells-where the throne of the adversary is; and
yet to you firmly retains my name; and thou did not deny my faith
even in the days in which Antipas was my witness, my faithful
one, who was killed among you, where the adversary dwells."
James Pryse connects Pergamos with the liver, the seat of second
sight (mantiken) according to Plato: "this is also the witness
Antipas 'who has indeed been slain by those who have lost even
the psychic function of the liver, as well as the intuition of
the intellectual nature. Anti-pa-s is simply mantis disguised by
having its initial M converted into PA and anagrammatically
transposed. [To solve the puzzle, it is only necessary to combine
the letters π and A, forming IAI, which when inverted makes a
passable M-and incidently shows why 'eminent scholars' have fail
to fine a satisfactory Greek derivation for the word or any
historical record of the supposed 'Martyr'." [Apocalypse
Unsealed, pp. 101-102]. Recall that ChSD Chesed, the sphere of
Jupiter, is the cosmic Moon or memory, and that Kaph, the Hebrew
letter of Jupiter is assigned to the liver, as well as to the
solar plexus, center of psychic activity. see 1029 (Greek), 20,
