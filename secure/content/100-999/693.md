### [Gaphrith](/keys/GPRITh) - גפרית
Sulphur; brimstone. [Genesis 19:24](http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm): *"Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah **brimstone** and fire from the LORD out of heaven"*

> Sulphur. The alchemical principle, composed of:

> - Gimel: the Moon -- Silver;
> - Peh: Mars -- iron;
> - Resh: Sun -- gold;
> - Yod: the operation of Mercury in Virgo;
> - Tav: Saturn -- Lead.

> These correspond to the parts of the body actively concerned in the Great Work, which are fundamental in the activities of human personality. see [7](7), [73](73).

> [beginning of text missing] the crystal which is the true philosopher's stone. (In the Aesch Mezareph or Purifying Fire, gophreeth is spelled גופריתא, [Gophritha](/keys/GVPRIThA), and given the value [700](700).) the text says: *"In the science of minerals the principle is referred to Binah, to the left because of its color... you must dig up this sulphur; and it is to be digged up out of the water, that you may have fire obtained from water."* see [700](700), [7](7), [73](73), [738](738), [1000](1000), [158](158), [1298](1298), [1436](1436) (Greek).

> גפרית is one of the names of the Red Stone, which is called also אבן האדם, [ehben hadam](/keys/ABN.HADM), and אדם, [Adam](/keys/ADM). see [45](45), [103](103). Also called brimstone. Pernety says in his Great Art, p.186 that this Red Stone is also termed phison, i.e. פישון, [pison](/keys/PIShVN) ([446](446)). see also [76](76), [372](372), [961](961), [287](287), [98](98), [144](144) (Latin).

> The complete text ([Aesch Mezareph](http://www.levity.com/alchemy/aesch8.html)) reads:

> > *Gophrith is Sulphur; in the Science of Minerals this Principle is referred to Binah, to the left because of its Colour; and to left also, Gold is wont to be referred; and [Charutz](/keys/ChRVTz) ([304](304)), a kind of Gold, is also referred to Binah, and being 7 in its lesser Number agrees with that of [Gophritha](/keys/GVPRIThA) ([700](700)).*

> > *Therefore the Gold of Natural Wisdom ought to be Charutz; that is digged out, or the like not excocted. And this is that Sulphur, which hath a fiery Colour, and is penetrating and changing to impure Earths; to wit, Sulphur with Salt, [Deuteronomy 29:23](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm) ("And that the whole land thereof is sulphur, and salt, and burning, that it is sown, not bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord overthrew in his anger, and his wrath"). Sulphur with Fire, rained down upon the Wicked,---that is the impure Metals, [Psalm 11:6](http://biblehub.com/psalm/11-6.htm) ("On the wicked he will rain fiery coals and burning sulfur; a scorching wind will be their lot.").*

> > *You must dig up this Sulphur; and it is to be digged out of the Water, that you mayest have Fire obtained from Water. "And if your Ways be right before the Lord, your Iron shall swim upon the Water," ([2 Kings 6:6](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-6.htm)). "Go thy way then to the River Jordan with Elisha"; see [v. 4](http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-4.htm). "But who shall declare the Geburah of the Lord?" ([Psalm 106:2](http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-2.htm)).*

> > *Many seek other Sulphurs, and he that hath entered the "House of the Paths" shall understand them, ([Proverbs 8:2](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm)) ('She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths'). For the Sulphurs of Gold and Iron, the Extraction whereof is taught by many, and is easy; also of Gold, Iron and Brass; also of Gold, Iron, Copper and Antimony, which are gathered together after Fulmination by Vinegar, out of the lixivium, which are changed into a Red Oil, with a moist Hydrargyrum,-- do tinge Silver. For from ([Proverbs 21:20](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-20.htm)) ('There is treasure to be desire, and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spends it up'), we know there is a Treasure to be desired and also an Oil to be found in the dwelling of a Man of Wisdom.*
