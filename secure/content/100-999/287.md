### [vuphar](/keys/VPAR) - ופאר
> Night demon of 3rd decanate of Taurus. This decanate is ruled by Saturn and suggest subconsciousness imbalance, resulting in lack of perseverance. The letters of the demon's name suggest the power of intuition (Vav), misdirected in acts of self-expression (Peh), using the undisciplined power of spirit (Aleph) to pervert the solar regenerative force (Resh). The 3rd decanate of Taurus in the Tarot minor arcana is assigned to the 7 of Pentacles. This represents the operation of Netzach, sphere of Venus, in Assiah, the material world of action. When illaspected, as here, the influence of the demon can indicate something promising which turns out badly; loss in speculation and unprofitable employment; financial restriction, unrealized hopes and wishes. The remedy is through rightly applied desires based on first-hand knowledge that the possibilities in man and his ability to transmute his environment are inexhaustible.
