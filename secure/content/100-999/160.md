### [qayam](/keys/QIIM) - קיים
> Stable, lasting, enduring. [QIIM] a special spelling of the adjective for "stable," using two Yods instead of the one which appears in the commoner spelling QIM. Thus the basic meaning of [QIIM] is found in its feminine verbal root QIMH signifying: to rise up, raising, erection. The secondary sense includes such ideas as "to stand out, to endure, to confirm, to establish," and it is from these that the adjective which designates the path of Mem is taken. see [510](510), [650](650), [90](90).

### [Antimony](/keys/ANTIMN) - אנטימן

### [kehseph, keseph](/keys/KSP) - כסף
> silver (alchemically the Moon). The sphere of the moon is Yesod, seat of the animal soul (311, 80). Silver refers to the reflective, mirroring power of subconsciousness. By means of this may be perceived the basic truth that "I" and "The God of my Father" are only two different ways of saying the same thing. KSP refers also to the idea or reversal, associated with Key 12, because silver is reflecting and reversed what it mirrors (as does water).

> *"Thus associated with qiim by numeration are the ideas of value (silver, money), and also the idea of the lunar current of the secret force, symbolized by silver [keseph]; of grace, pleasure, suitability [noam]; of the descent of the cosmic energy into form [nawfal]; of the weight of ponderability of physical manifestation, typified as a stone or rock [sehia]; of the organic expression of the potencies of the life-power, symbolized among all nations by the image of a tree [etz] and of the reflection of the ideas of the universal mind in forms or images [tzelem]."* [Paul Case: True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (4th), p.374]

In French it is, Le Pendu, and in Italian L'apposo, which means Literally, "The apprehended", or "the caught".

> a lance or spear. Name of the first murderer. Refers to the false crown of will-power (Key 16) that is shattered by divine illumination (see 37).

> Fabre D'Olivet comments: *"ATh-QIN, the self-sameness of Kain... [Genesis 4:1](http://biblehub.com//.htm): ("And Adam knew Eve his wife: and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, 'I have gotten a man for the Lord.'") Need I speak of the importance that the people of the orient have attached to proper names, and of which deep mysteries their sages have often hidden beneath the names?... Moses is the one of the writers of antiquity, who has developed most subtly the art of composing proper names... Moses has often been obliged to throw over them a veil, that I ought and wish to respect. Although I might perhaps give the literal word, I shall not do so. I inform my reader of this in order that he may be watchful: for if he desire it, nothing shall prevent him from knowing. The root of the name Kain is QN, which is composed of the eminently compressive and trenchant sign Qoph, and that of produced being Nun. It develops the idea of strongest compression and of most centralized existence: in the proper name under consideration, it is presented animated by the sign of manifested power: thus QIN, Cain signify the strong; the powerful, the rigid, the vehement, and also the central, that which serves as basis, rule, measure; that which agglomerates, appropriates, seizes, comprehends, assimilates with itself. It is in this last sense that Moses appears to have represented it in the verb which follows."* [I did center, QNIThI]. [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp.122-123]

> According to Gaskell, Cain is *"a symbol of the center of this personality-the I am I feeling in the lower mind, which causes the illusion of separateness, and represent the lower self... The sense of self and separateness supervises the growth of the lower desires which spring form the lower nature."* [Dictionary of All Scriptures and Myths, p.136]

> Swedenborg maintains that *"By 'Cain' is signified faith separate from love. A 'tiller of the ground' is one who is without charity, whatever pretensions he may make to faith which when separated form love is no faith."* [Arcana Coelestia].

> Jacob Boehme says that *"Cain, whereby is understood in the language of nature, a source out of the center of the fiery desire, a self-full will of the fiery might of the soul."* [Mysterium Magnum, p.166]

> the Zohar [I:54A] comments: *"Cain was the nest (qina) of the evil habitations which came into the world from the evil side."* (P.172)

> Carlo Suares says: *"Qaheen, as life-death, life-death, is the ceaseless, intermittent pulsation that will always triumph over the female element of resistance forged with blood. He is here, now, present, as he was present always, although more often than not unidentified... it is not surprising that for the conditioned mind Cain is a killer, whereas he is the very action of IHVH."* [The Cipher of Genesis, pp. 141-142]

## Greek/Latin:

### [Interiora Terrae](/latin?word=Interiora+Terrae) (Lt)
> Interior of the Earth. Part of the alchemical phrase in Secret Symbols (page 17). The interior of the earth "is the inner, Life of Man. When one follows the alchemical admonition, and visits this region, he enters into the state of consciousness the Yogis call Samadhi. In Sanskrit this word has affinities with the ideas of burial and self-immolation. The practices whereby it is attained are all directed toward arresting, or suspending, the flow of mental images. They are also aimed at abstracting attention from sensory perceptions.

### [nequaquam vacuum](/latin?word=nequaquam+vacuum) (Lt)
> nowhere a vacuum. Inscription found of the tomb of brother C.R., around a circle containing the picture of a Lion, the element of Fire. The inscription means that space is filled with the universal fiery essence. The symbolic lion is one of four (ox, eagle, man) representing-one of the four fixed signs of the zodiac, appearing in the visions of Ezekiel and St. John, and in Tarot Keys 10 and 21. These signs--the 5th, 2nd, 8th and 11th total 26, and these mystical creatures are one of many glyphs for the name IHVH.

### [Deus Lux Solis](/latin?word=Deus+Lux+Solis) (Lt)
> God, light of the Sun. From the "Chemical Marriage of Christian Rosenkreutz." Here is a very definite statement of the occult doctrine that radiant energy, or light, is one with the Life-power.
