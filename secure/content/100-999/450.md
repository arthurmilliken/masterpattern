### [shefah](/keys/ShPO) - 
> abundance, overmeasure, emanation; to flow [Deuteronomy 33:19]. Intelligence of Cheth Connected with water. Shin shows the 4th dimensions as the Great sea, Binah. Peh is a symbol of Mezla, the holy influence descending from Kether. Ayin is the way the same power is interpreted as superficial appearances reported by sensation. he noun "influence" suggests the notion of water. The Hebrew shefah occurs once in the Old Testament, where it is translated "abundance." "They shall suck the abundance of the seas." Here the idea of abundance is directly connected with water. In this passage there is also an occult reference to time, because the word for "seas" is [IMIM], yomim, identical in spelling with a noun which signifies "days." ShPO shepa. Influence. see 536. "Part of the Path names of Intelligence of the House of Influence (Cheth) and Intelligence of Mediating Influence (Tiphareth).

> "In Tarot the word Shefah (ShPO) 'influence', is represented by Keys 20, 16 and 15. Key 20 is a symbol of the 4th dimension, of the place of being which is above, yet within, all other planes. This key shows the coffins of personal consciousness floating of the great sea of Binah, understanding. The 18th Path proceeds form Binah, as we go down the Tree of Life, and the same paths leads to Binah on the way of return. Key 16, corresponding to the second letter of ShPO, shows the holy influence as a lighting flash, which destroys the tower of false knowledge. Key 15, corresponding to the third letter of ShPo, shows how man interprets the operation of this same holy influence when he knows nothing about it except the superficial appearance reported by the physical sense. Under this last aspect the Holy influence propounds riddles to us, and presents us with problems, Thus the sphinxes of Key 7 and the devil of Key 15 are related symbols. Both represent incongruous combinations of human and animal elements. They are they types of the great magic agent, the force employed in all works of practical occultism." [Paul Case: True and Invisible,(4th) p.424]
