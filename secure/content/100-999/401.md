### [eth](/keys/ATh) - את
> Word used to indicate a direct object; in Golden Dawn usage, essence or Spirit. Symbol of God. Ate Thou.

> Fabre D'Olivet observes: *"את Ath. The Potential sign united to that of sympathy and of reciprocity, constitutes a root which develops the relations of things to themselves, their mutual tie, their sameness or selfsameness relative to the universal soul, their very substance. This root differs form the root אן in what the former designates as the active existence of being, I, and what the latter designates as the passive or relative existence, thee. אן is the subject, as character, following the definition of the Kantist philosophers; את is the object. את that which serves as character, type, symbol, sign, mark, etc."* [[The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p.300](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/n321/mode/2up)
