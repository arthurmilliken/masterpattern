### [Nisetar](/keys/NSThR) - נסתר
> hidden, occult, mysterious, concealed. From the verb סתר [sawther](/keys/SThR), to hide, to veil, to cover, to conceal. Part of the path name of Netzach. The *"brilliant splendor of all the intellectual power which are beheld by the eye of understanding and the thought of faith."* The operation of this forces open the "eye of understanding" -- the awakening of an organ in the human brain. [Nun](/keys/N), the great magical agent is the force which kills and can be brought under control by training the desire nature. [Samekh](/keys/S), The nature of the process whereby it is brought under control; the Holy Guardian Angel or Higher self is actively concerned in the Great Work, a power above the personality level which transforms it. [Tav](/keys/Th), the interpretation of existence in an occultists mind by his work. He in whom the occult intelligence becomes manifest sees nature with new eyes -- a consciousness of the cosmos and of eternal life. [Resh](/keys/R), the regeneration of human personality effected by occult practice. Through control of the secret force, attained by directing the emotions, one makes a new kind of body different from that of the average human being, including a degree of physical mastery almost beyond the power to imagine.

> [Nun](/keys/N): the very beginning of true occult philosophy and practice is vigorous, vital, healthful use of the transforming power of imagination. [Samekh](/keys/S), the work of the artist is a continual testing, and endless experimentation, a long probation. [Tav](/keys/Th), this work requires a thorough understanding of the principle of limitation -- he must be specific. [Resh](/keys/R), the adaptation of life to the expression of beauty demands a child-like mental attitude. see [1060](1060), [148](148). Also נסתר [nesether](/keys/NSThנצחR) to hide oneself; to be hidden, concealed; to be demolished, destroyed. see [148](148).

> "*The doctrines of the grade of Philosophus are six in number, and are derived form the letters of the words נצח, [Netzach](/keys/NTzCh), or Victory... and נסתר, [nesether](/keys/NSThR), meaning occult which designates the special mode of consciousness associated by Qabalist with the seventh circle. There are only six doctrines, although the two words comprise seven letters, because both Netzach and nesether begin the same letter, Nun...*

> - *[Death, Key 13](13) ([Nun](/keys/N)): The dissolution of form is a fundamental tendency of the cosmic process. All things change. All conditions pass away.*
> - *[Temperance, Key 14](14) ([Samekh](/keys/S)): Every human being is under the direct guidance of the One Identity. Every personal action is a special and particular expression of the One Identity's overshadowing activity. Knowledge of this is the secret of the perfect freedom of the truly wise.*
> - *[The World, Key 21](21) ([Tav](/keys/Th)): all form is a limitation of the infinite energy of the Life-power. The primary cause of limitation is the image-making power of the universal mind. Every act of human imagination is really a particular expression, though a personal center, of this image-making power. hence human imagination is, in kind, though not in degree, the same as the imagination that forms the universe...*
> - *[The Sun, Key 19](19) ([Resh](/keys/R)): Human personality is a synthesis of all cosmic processes. Man summarizes all that precedes him, and is the point of departure for the manifestation of a new creature. The natural man is the seed of the spiritual man."*

### [yarak](/keys/IRKf) - ירך
> the thigh, but used as a euphemism for the phallus. In the [Apocalypse (19:16)](https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm), the Greek noun μηρὸν [meros](/greek?word=mhros) ([418](418)) has the same esoteric meaning. This is linked closely to Qabalistic ideas which are associated with the [7th Path](7) having to do with the activity of the generative and reproductive powers of the One Life. The forces at work in those parts of the human body which are the seat of man's strongest desires are the ones which must be controlled in order to win the victory of which the reward is liberation. The Hebrew lexicon gives: thigh, lion, side, flank; base; leg of a letter. [Kaph = 500] see [230](230).
