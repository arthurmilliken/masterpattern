## Greek/Latin:

---

### [Sancti Spiritus](/latin?word=sancti+spiritus) (Lt)
Holy Spirit. In the Fama, this "house" is where the members of the Rosicrucian Order hold their annual meetings.

> *"Third: That every year, upon the day C., they should met together at the house **Sancti Spiritus,** or write the cause of his absence"* [[Fama Fraternitatis](https://archive.org/stream/PaulFosterCase-TheTrueAndInvisibleRosicrucianOrder4thEd-1985#page/n21/mode/2up)]

### [hebdomen](/greek?word=ebdomhn) (Gr) - ἑβδόμην
Seventh. [John 4:52](http://biblehub.com/john/4-52.htm): *"And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."*

Could this "seventh hour" be a reference to the exact time upon the day "C" that the members of the Rosicrucian order meet? Or perhaps a reference to the "Seventh House"?
