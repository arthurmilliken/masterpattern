## 666 - Six Hundred Sixty-Six
Number of the Beast. 2x9x37. [15x15 + 21x21]. 1+2+...+36=666. Also the sum of the squares of the first seven prime numbers: (2x2 + 3x3 + 5x5 + 7x7 + 11x11 + 13x13 + 17x17 = 666).

> The total numbers in the magic square of the sun, and the value of the magic line of the sun. A solar number representing man as a center of solar sctivity and referring specifically to Tiphareth.

> We think of this number usually as being that of the mysterious Beast mentioned in Revelation. It is actually a solar number, and in the Apocalypse its special meaning is a cryptic reference to the Roman Empire, and to one particular Caesar, Nero. For the symbol of the Caesars was a solar disk, and the essential spirit of Roman imperialism was a crass, materialistic exaltation of physical force. *[Gematria PFC]*

> Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. *[[Revelation 13:18](http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm)]*
