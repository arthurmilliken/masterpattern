## 113 - One Hundred Thirteen (prime)

### [ehben bokhan](/keys/ABN.BChN)
> a tried stone [Isaiah 28:16]. Reference to
the mystical lamb with seven horns [Secret symbols, page 35]. The lamb is KR (CR), and the 7 horns are the personified powers of the brethren who helped C.R. found the Rosicrucian order. see 137, 220, 314, 1483, 1973.

### [ha-bonaim](/keys/HBVNIM)
> "the builders" [Psalm 118:22] "The stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner." see 1389 (Greek), 673.

### [mah-ha-banaiy](/keys/MH-HBNAI)
> what! the builders! see 45, 108.

### [mah-ha-boneh](/keys/MH-HBVNH)
> Power of the Builder. Observe that 113 is the result from [what! the builders!], an interpretation accepted by many modern commentators, and that is equivalent numerically to MKBNA (knoll), which closely approximates the continental form. if to 113 we add 90, 79, 732 and 548 the total is 113+1490 = 1603, a primary number whose digits reduce to 10 (26+1496=1522). If we take in the above, the final Nun as 700 then it will be 740+79+732+1248 = 2799, and 113 +2799 = 2912 = 23x7x26 or 24x7x13. This seems rather significant especially as 113 may be taken in either the continental or English version. Also 2799 = 33x311 and 311 is the reflection of 113. 311 includes among its means AISh [a man, husband] and RPAL [Raphael], angelic patron of Building Mercury. see 311.

### [ha-neahawbim](/keys/HNAHBIM)
> the lovers, the beloved. Title of Key 6 [Zain]. [2 Samuel 1:23] "Saul and Jonathan were lovely [beloved] and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were strong than lions." (David's lament at news of the death of Saul, and Saul's son Jonathan). from NAH, "comely, becoming, befitting."

### [Beulah](/keys/BOVLH)
> Beulah, "espoused". [Isaiah 62:4] "Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah ["my delight is in her, #192], and thy land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married." A reference to the New Jerusalem ["Abode of Peace"] of prophecy.

### [selichawah](/keys/SLIChH)
> forgiveness, pardon; penitential.

### [Nechemyah](/keys/NChMIH)
> Nehemiah, "Yah comforts"; name of a Persian cup-bearer to the king who helped the Jews rebuild the wall of Jerusalem after their return form exile. [Nehemiah 1:1] "The words of Nehemiah son of Hekaliah: 'in the month of Kisev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa (2) Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned that about the Jewish remanent that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem."

### [peleg](/keys/PLG)
> Godwin gives: Peleg, son of Eber; father of Rev. [Genesis 10:25] "Two sons were born to Eber: one was named Peleg, because in this time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan." 2. Phaleg; Olympic planetary sprit of Mars. Davidson adds that this angel is also known by Phalec, and say he is "ruling prince of the order of angels. Phalec is also the governing spirit of the planet Mars (and hence often referred to, as he is by Corellus Agrippa, as the wail lord). Of the 106 Olympic provinces, Phalec has dominion over 35. His day, for invocation, is Tuesday. According to Agrippa, heaven has 196 provinces, with 7 supreme angles governing them, of whom Phalec is one.. in white magic, Phaleg is one of the 7 stewards of heaven." [Davidson: Dictionary of Angels, p. 223-224]
