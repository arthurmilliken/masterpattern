### [Zerbal](/keys/ZORBL) - זערבל
> (A A S R) [or Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, see Massey] The reference that is associated with זערבל has to do with the quadarature of the circle.

Quadrature suggest the 4 elements of Malkuth (Fire, Water, Air, Earth].

> *"Zerbal: The name of King Solomon's Captain of the Guards, in the Degree of Intimate Secretary. No such person is mentioned in Scripture, and it is therefore an invention of the ritualist who fabricated the Degree.
