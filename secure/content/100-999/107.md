107 (prime)
The sum of Ab (3), Aima (52) and Ben (52), the names of the
Qabalistic trinity: Father (Chokmah), Mother (Binah), and Son
(Tiphareth).
MGN DVD Mawgen David. Shield of David, or Shield of Love
(hexagram). The great star in the Hermit's hexagonal lantern is
the macrocosmic star, referring to the Ego in Tiphareth linked by
light to the paternal-maternal cosmic forces (see 701, 346, 20).
MNI ADM Beni Adam. Sons of Adam; sons of man (Humanity) [Psalm
90:3]. "Thou turnest man to destruction, and says 'return ye sons
of Adam.' "Behind these words, attributed traditionally to
Moses, is the idea that really the BNI-ADM are identical with the
BNI-HALIM (148). ANVSh, Enosh, is the state of the Sons of God
when they suppose themselves to be merely the Sons of Adam, and
the return is to the original Angelic condition. Now in this is
the deepest mystery of Saturn closely related to the secret of
Mars. The Sons of Adam have forgotten that they are truly Sons
of God. For them there is no rest, and in divers ways they seek
relief from the intolerable tension that is produced by the sense
of separateness. Only a few members of the human race realize
their true status, and live accordingly. The rest are turned to
destruction until utter collapse of their supposed autonomy sends
them back. Now these deluded ones see death everywhere, are
taught survival perhaps, but do not usually really believe it.
Thus they seek vicarious immortality in posterity, and surrender
themselves to death. They who have come into the peace of the
Sabbath are free from this delusion, and know better than to
prolong the chain of birth and death. [31st Communication
2/2/48]. see 713, 1200, 1308.
MLAKIV mahlayawkayu. "ye angels of his". [Psalm 103:20] "Bless
the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word." Angels is
also translated, "messengers". see 91, 158.
GLOD Gileawd. Gilead, "hill of testimony". [Genesis 31:21] "So
he [Jacob] his face toward the Mount Gilead." see 117, Abdiel;
221 (Jair), 317.
AVNN Onawn. "Onan", probably a clan, of Canaanite origin, that
lost its identity in the amalgamation of clans incidental to the
growth of the tribe of Judah (Sun, Leo). In [Genesis 38:4] "She
(Shua) conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him
Onan." And in [38:9] "But Onan knew that the offspring would not
be his; so whenever he lay with his brothers wife, he spilled his
seed on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his
brother." Connected with self-pollution. Note the power of Spirit
(Aleph) linked (Vav) to reproductive force (Nun) in perpetual
cycles of its own use, and abuse (Nun). see 757.
ZQ zeq. chain; flaming arrow. [Proverbs 26:18] "Like a madman,
shooting firebrands or deadly arrows, (19) is a man who deceives
his neighbor and says, 'I was only toiling.'" Also in [Psalm
149:8] "To bind their kings with fetters, their nobles with
shackles of iron." Key 15.
Fabre D'Olivet comments: "ZQ. Every idea of diffusion in time or
space. The Arabic [word] as onomatopoetic root denotes the action
of pecking. ZQ a chain, suite, flux; a draught of anything
whatsoever. That which spreads, glides, flows in space or time.
Thence, years, old age, and the veneration which is attached to
it: water and the purity which ensues: a chain and the strength
which attends it; an arrow, etc. In a restricted sense, the
Arabic [word] signifies a leather bottle where in one puts any
kind of liquid. It is doubtless the Hebrew word ShQ or the
Chaldaic SQ, a sack." [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp. 344-345]
VSIAL Usiel. According to Mathers, in [Sepher Sephiroth, p. 16],
and angel of Netzach of Briah; corresponds to the 7 of Cups or
sphere of Venus and desire in the creative world. Davidson gives:
Uzziel, 'Strength of God', and says this is a fallen angel, but
the spelling may be OZIAL. [Dictionary of Angels, p. 299]
BITzH beytzah. egg; symbol of the manifested universe. Given by
Mathers in [Sepher Sephiroth, p. 16]
Latin
Christos (Lt). Christ
LUX Domini (Lt). Light of the Lord.
