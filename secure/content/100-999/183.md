### [ha-khahphatz](/keys/HChPTz) - החפץ 
> to bend or curve. The English "bent" has the same connotation. Relates to the [21st path](21) of [Kaph](/keys/K), the "Inclination to Seek." see [636](636), [892](892).

The implication is that, by undertaking a journey or quest, you will eventually end up where you started, but with the wisdom that what you seek is, has always been, and will always be in your possession. The identification of החפץ with λόγοι or "words" indicates that it is through telling your own story that you are able to "grasp" the power of your own identity.

## Greek

### [Logoi](/greek?word=logoi) (Gr) - λόγοι
> Words. A technical mystery term identical with the Sanskrit Mantra, the "Word of Power." see [214](214).
