### [Aleph (letter-name)](/keys/ALP) - אלף
> Ox, bull. The activity whereby the ONE reflects itself to itself, and so produces the number 2. The first out-pouring of spiritual influence into the realm of experience.

> Also:

> - [Eleph](/keys/ALP): A thousand, family, clan, cattle.

### [Pehleh](/keys/PLA) - פלא
> Wonderful, admirable, mystical, marvelous, hidden, extraordinary. Adjective used to describe Kether. The reversal of the meaning of Aleph, whereby the limitless light is condensd by a contracting spiral into the first point or the crown. Used in Hebrew [Isaiah 9:6] as the first of a series of divine names. Also to divide, separate, distinguish. Root meaning is that which is set off; miracle. Rfers to the initial act of apparent division, or separation, whereby manifestation is begun. Pehleh suggests that Aleph's power in the 11th path of Aleph is like a reflection of the power of Kether. See 157, 507, 620, 579, 876, 831, 142, 217, 242, 311, 255, 532, 364.

### [Ehben-Khane](/keys/ABN.ChN) - אבן חן
> A precious stone; stone of grace; jewel. The alchemists's "Stone of the Wise." The realization that the One Ego in Tiphareth is identical to the cosmic Life-Force in Chokmah. In Proverbs 17:8, [Khane](/keys/ChN) signifies grace, favor, something precious, goodwill. It forms the initials of [Chokmah Nesethrah](/keys/ChKMH.NSThRH), "The Secret Wisdom," i.e. Qabalah. Thus the three words (ALP, ABN, ChN) suggest the multiplication, or development, of the stone of the secret wisdom (i.e. the stone of the wise) through the power that may be designated either as AChD or AHBH. See [53](53), [58](58), 788. *[Gematria PFC]*

> [Proverbs 17:8](http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm): *A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.*

> The Zohar [IV:1840] observes: *The lower world is always in a receptive state -- being called 'a good (precious) stone' -- and the upper world only communicates to it according to the condition in which it is found at any given time. If it shows a smiling countenance, light and joy from the world above pour down upon it; but if it be sad and downcast, it receives the severity of judgement, as it is written 'worship the Lord in Joy' [Psalm 100:2](http://biblehub.com/psalms/100-2.htm). That the joy of man may draw upon him supernal joy. So, too, does the lower sphere affect the upper: according to the degree of awakening below there is awakening and heavenly joy above. Therefore the Israelites have to awaken the voice of the trumpet, which is compounded of fire, water and wind, and all are made one and the voice ascends and strikes that '[precious stone](/keys/ABN.ChN)', which then receives the various colors of this voice and then draws down upon itself the attribute from above according to the color which it shows. And when it is duly prepared by this voice, mercy issues from on high and rests upon it, so that it is enfolded in mercy, both from above and below.*

### [Elyah](/keys/OLYA) - עליא
The Most High

### [Brother P.A.L.](/keys/PAL) - פאל
One of the founders of the Rosicrucian Order, "who had determined to go to the Holy Land," and who "died in Cyprus, and so never came to Jerusalem."

The reference "died in Cyprus" could indicate [Key 13: Death](13), which is also the [24th Path of Nun](24), connecting Netzach (the Sphere of Venus) to Tiphareth. Cyprus is the origin of the metal copper in the ancient world, and Copper was the metal of Venus.

P=Mouth A=Ox L=Ox-Goad. This indicates the Word of God as the directive force of the Life-Breath.

"The doctrines of the grade of Ipsissimus are derived from the
letters of this word. Kether is also called the Admirable or
Mystical Intelligence. The Hebrew is Pahlah (PLA) said to be the
'light which imparts understanding of the beginning-which is
without beginning'... 4) Peh, The Tower. The extraordinary words
of a 'knower of the self' are largely applications of the Mars
force-essentially like electricity and governed by similar laws,
the force in inimical to man only so long as he misunderstands
and misuses it. Rightly understood it breaks down all structures
of error, overthrows the false knowledge of separateness and rids
the personality of all delusion... 5) Lamed, Justice. An
Ipsissimus is a perfectly poised personality. He has transmuted
ambition entirely but works as do those who are ambitious. He has
transmuted desire of life but respects life as do those who
desire it. He has transmuted desire for comfort but is happier
than those who live for happiness. His will is one with the
Originating Will of the universe, and he shares the mastery of
the Will over all things. 6) Aleph, Key 0, The Fool. The 'Knower
of the Self' is the Mystical Fool of all sacred allegories.
Nothing binds him. he is beyond every limitation of 'this world.'
His motives and his actions are incomprehensible to the masses of
merely natural men. Sometimes they worship him. Often they deride
him. Always they fear him. His instruction they may grasp, so far
as he makes it comprehensible to intellect, but the essence of
the man eludes them. They who have attained to the highest Grade
of the Invisible Order have few companions in the world, yet they
are never lonely. They live in silent but vivid communication
which each other, and they share in the bliss of the Heavenly
vision. Their light shines in the darkness of the 'false world,'
but that darkness cannot swallow it up." [Paul Case: True and
Invisible, p. 307-308]

###/keys/xxxABN ChN ehben-khane
> A precious stone; stone of grace; jewel.
The alchemist's "Stone of the Wise." The realization that the One
Ego in Tiphareth is identical to the cosmic Life-Force in
Chokmah. In Proverbs 17:8, Chane KN, signifies grace, favor,
something precious, goodwill. It forms the initials of Chokmah
Nestawrah, "The Secret Wisdom," i.e. Qabalah. Paul Case notes:
"Thus the three words (ALP, ABN, CN) suggest the multiplication,
or development, of the stone of the secret wisdom (i.e. stone of
the wise) through the power that may be designated either as AChD
or as AHBH. But, since ABN-ChN = ALP, is it not clear [text ends]
see 53, 58, 788.

[Proverbs 17:8] "A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him
who has it: wherever it turns, it prospers." The Zohar [IV:1840,
pp. 126-127] observes: "The lower world is always in a receptive
state-being called 'a good (precious) stone'-and the upper world
only communicates to it according to the condition in which it is
found at any given time. If it shows a smiling countenance, light
and joy from the world above pour down upon it; but if it be sad
and downcast, it receives the severity of judgement, as it
written 'worship the Lord in Joy' [Psalm 100:2] That the joy of
man may draw down upon him supernal joy. So, too, does the lower
sphere affect the upper: according to the degree of awakening
below there is awakening and heavenly joy above. Therefore the
Israelites hast to awaken the voice of the trumpet, which is
compounded of fire, water and wind, and all are made one and the
voice ascends and strikes that 'precious stone', which then
receives the various colors of this voice and then draws down
upon itself the attribute from above according to the color which
it shows. And when it is duly prepared by this voice, mercy
issues from on high and rest upon it, so that it is enfolded in
mercy, both above and below." (ABN ChN = ALP).
