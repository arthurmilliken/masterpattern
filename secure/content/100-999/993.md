## 993 - Nine Hundred Ninety-Three
(3x331). The final page of Shakespeare's First Folio is "mislabeled" as 993 instead of 399. It begins thus (punctuation and spacing preserved):

    .   Make no Collection of it. Let him shew
    .   His skill in the construction.
    .     *Luc. Philarmonus.*
    .     *Sooth.* Heere,my good Lord.
    .     *Luc.* Read,and declare the meaning.
    .
    .     *Reades.*
    .   *WHen as a Lyons whelpe,shall to himselfe unknown,with-
    .   out seeking finde, and bee embrac'd by a peece of tender
    .   Ayre: And when from a stately Cedar shall be lopt branches,
    .   which being dead many yeares,shall after revive, bee joynted to
    .   the old Stocke , and freshly grow, then shall Posthumus end his
    .   miseries,Britaine be fortunate,and flourish in Peace and Plen-
    .   tie.*
