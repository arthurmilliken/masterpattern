363 (3x11x11)
ShDI AL ChI Shaddai El Chai. Almighty God of Life, The Almighty
Living God, Lord of the Universe. The Divine Name attributed to
Yesod and to the Nine of Wands. The Almighty ever-living one
which centers itself in all animate forms and finds its highest
expression in the life of man. see 80, 11, 18, 23, 207, 570, 220,
127, 314, 31.
"Throughout eternity, with no cessation does the utterance of the
Ruach Elohim the might of El Shaddai the source of Life; and the
Living Soul Nephesh is the vehicle of that utterance. Even so
may you see it in the letters of Nephesh, for the first relates
to Perpetuity, and the second to Utterance, while the third
standeth in the alphabet for Ruach Elohim the Fiery Breath of the
Eternal Spirit of Life. To this the name Shaddai El Chai refers;
for the Nephesh, or the Vital Soul is that same Almighty
Everliving One, which centers Itself in all animate forms, and
findeth its highest expression in the life of man. Through
countless generations that Life perpetuateth Its utterance by
means of successive generations of human bodies. It is on this
account that the Wise aver that in Yesod is the field of renewal
through procreation. Now AL ShDI, or more fully, ShDI AL ChI, is
truly Lord of the Universe, and Holy is His Name, Blessed be He.
Never have the Sons of the Wise forgotten this, nor have they
ever blasphemed the source of Life. Yet have they known full
well that not be generation only is the command "be fruitful and
multiply" to be fulfilled. There is a fruitfulness beyond that
of the flesh, and a multiplication of the power of life beyond
the bringing forth of sons and daughters of the flesh. Thus in
the word Yesod, may you read Yod, Sod - or Sod, Yod the secret of
Yod. Now what is Yod? As a letter it betokeneth Creative Power,
for it is the Hand. But the wise know it also as the channel for
the transmission of Life, and Life is Chaiah, seated in Chokmah,
to which Yod specially pertains. For Chaiah is none other than
AVR. Now see, AVR is the number 207, and this is 9 times 23.
Now 23 is the number of ChIH, Chaiah, and 9 is the number of
Yesod; furthermore Chaiah is in Chokmah and is thus to be
understood as the power of AB the Father. Thus may you know that
Life and Light are one; that Light is always pure and always
Holy, and that the extension of Light is its multiplication
through forms. But forms are manifest in varying degrees, and
when it is thine office to bring forth subtle forms, thou fails
if thou miss thine opportunity through the false belief that in
the bringing forth of forms less subtle there is any essential
failure. Failure is the missing of one's highest possibility.
But what may be failure for thee, may well be supreme attainment
for thy Brother. For wherever Life is multiplied the giver of
increase is Shaddai El Chai, and nothing that He effecteth hath
in it any loss or evil. Evil are man's judgments, but Life
Itself remaineth forever good.
Now the name ShDI (314) AL (31) ChI (18) begins with the number
314, then followeth 31, and ChI is 18. This bringeth the whole
to 363, and see, this is 11x11x3. Now 11 is AVD (Od, see Franz
Bardon definition of Od) and 3 is Gimel. AVD is the magic power
and Gimel is the beginning of Guph the body. Aleph is the
Breath, Vav is the Link, Daleth is the Door of Life and is Nogah
also, which giveth the Victory. In Gimel or 3 is Recollection
and Union, and for the wise the letters of AVD speak with a loud
tongue. In Yesod is all this centered and they who know the
secret of Yod, become the extenders of the paternal Life and
Light. Thus is Yesod called the Sphere of the Moon, and that
same Moon pertains also to Gimel, the letter of Union. Blessed
are they who hear and understand, and understanding, live as they
know.
There are many who seek to be spiritual at the expense of the
body. They repudiate all that pertains to Yesod because they
misunderstand its real significance. You may have wondered what
this section of the Text has to do with the Astral plane, for
there is a spate of words both printed and uttered concerning the
astral, mostly based on complete misapprehension. Yet the Text
points straight to the one thing, and that is, that the mystery
of the 9th Sephira is a secret of Yod. For competent Qabalists
this will be sufficient, and the Text says quite enough to
establish certainty, for it points out that Yod is the letter of
AB, and dilates upon Chiah, so that one must be a tyro indeed who
does not see that the secret has to do with the radiance of the
stars, that is with Light, which is one with Life." [27th
Communication 1/15/48].
ZRO ALHIM zera Elohim. "a godly seed", seed of God or offspring
of God. [Malachi 2:15] "And did not he make one [covenant]? Yet
had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he
might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and
let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth."
Literally, seed of God, or offspring of God. This connects with
the attribution of Yesod to the reproductive organs of the Grand
Man. Brother C.R. is described in the Fama as "A seed planted in
the breast of Jesus." Note that the New Testament says the "seed"
is the 'word". see 220, 430, 923, 277, 86; 878 (Greek).
HMShICh ha-Messiach. The Messiah. The Messiah is the Christ
consciousness seated in Tiphareth. Yesod is the reflection of the
Ego in Tiphareth and is thus of the same essential nature. Note
that the New Testament says the "seed" is the "word". The serpent
is the savior in disguise. see 220, 358, 430.
BIH ShMV Be-Yah shemo. By (or in) His name, Yah [Psalm 68:4].
The American translation gives: whose name is Yah. Applied to the
rider of the heavens, described in verse 5 by the word (B)ORBVTh,
which, in addition to meaning sky or heaven, also means desertplain,
wilderness, literally the vast expanse of the sky. But in
verse 33 of the same Psalm he is called the rider in the heavens
again: LRKB BShMI ShMI-QDM, "Who rides upon the heavens, the
heavens of ancient days," (i.e. primordial heavens). QDM is the
word for ancient days, or the primordial heavens. It also means:
east, front (as the opposite of back).
BN AISh Ben-Ish. Son of Man. The scripture says Adam was formed
from the 'dust of the ground", and careless superficial reading
of the letter of this text and others like it, has led to an
erroneous conception that man is a creature essentially different
from his creator. To correct this, Qabalist add ADM and AISh the
noun BN, Ben, son, in order to bring out the idea that the
essential man is 'begotten, not made'. Humanity is of the same
essence as divinity. 'Man" and "God' are members of the same
genus. As an old Rosicrucian aphorism puts it: 'Man is the son of
God, and there is no God but man." [TL 26:3] see 97.
GN BODN MQDM gan be-Eden mi-qedem. "A Garden of Eden Eastward."
[Genesis 2:8] "And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in
Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed." see 144, 53,
124.
HNChSh ha-nachash. the serpent. [Genesis 3:1] "Now the serpent
was more subtle than any beast which the Lord God made. And he
said unto the woman, 'yea, hath God said, you shall not eat of
every tree of the garden?" see 585, 358.
