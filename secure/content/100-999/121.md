> Fabre D'Olivet comments: *"מט. this root, composed of the sign of exterior and passive action, united to that of resistance, develops all ideas of motion or emotion given to something; vacillation; stirring; a communicated movement especially downward. The Arabic [word] has the same sense. As verb, this root indicates the action of drawing, stretching, extending by pulling. מוט. Action of moving, rousing, budging, stirring, agitating; going, following, happening, arriving, etc."* [[The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p. 389](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/388/mode/2up)]

The Arabic [word] is an onomatopoetic root which expresses the bleating, bellowing of animals. בעה. An anxious inquiring, a search; a turgescence, a boiling; action of boiling, etc."* [[The Hebrew Tongue Restored, p. 306-307](https://archive.org/stream/hebraictongueres00fabriala#page/n327/mode/2up)]
