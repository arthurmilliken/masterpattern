### [Tenah](/keys/ThANH) - תאנה

> [beginning of text missing] ...almost a miracle. The letters of the name תאנה [Tenah](/keys/ThANH) illustrate that fact: The symbol of the fig tree Th, Tav engendering directly Aleph, in a perpetual life.

> תא [Tav-Aleph](/keys/ThA) culminate in נה [Nun-Heh](/keys/NH). This explains Jesus mysterious curse upon the unfruitful fig-tree [Matthew 21: 18-22] If it does not give forth the Aleph, it is not a real fig tree, it is an imposter." [Song of Songs, p. 75]

###/keys/HH-VV-DLTh Heh-Vav-Daleth
> Hod, spelled in plenitude. also Fig
Tree in Fruit, Mountain of Myrrh, legs, thighs, street, ways. see
15.

###/keys/KThVL ketol
> Wall of a House. Refers to Tiphareth. Rosenroth
in [K.D.L.C.K. p.473] says that it is referred to Tiphareth in
the Zohar, when it is joined to Malkuth per justum [i.e.
rightly].

###/keys/ThANH tehaynaw
> Opportunity and purpose; occasion and design;
copulation, a coming together, lust.

> Fabre D'Olivet comments: As to the word ThANH... to distinguish
the sign Tav, a sign that the most ordinary grammarians have
distinguished as an heemanthe or paragogic, and to which they
have attributed, under these two relations, the faculty of
expressing the continuity of things and their reciprocity. this
distinction made, the word ANH has no longer the least
difficulty. It is an expression of grief not only in Hebrew, but
in Samaritan, Chaldaic, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic. It is formed
from an onomatopoetic root which depicts the groans, sobs, pain
and the anhelation of a person who suffers. This expressive root
belongs to all tongues. One finds it united to the Sign Tav on
several occasions, and especially to express a deep, mutual
sorrow. It is presumable that the fir-tree has received the
metaphorical name of ThANH on account of the mournfulness of its
foliage, from which lactescent tears appear to flow from its
fruits. However that may be, the onomatopoetic figure which is
here presented for the first time, although it may be somewhat
rare in Hebrew, is far from being wholly foreign as the Rad.
Vocab. has shown. It is at first, in Hebrew, as in the Arabic
[word], only a kind of exclamation as alas! but, transformed into
a verb by means of the convertible sign Vav, it becomes AVN or
ANVH whose meaning is, to be plunged in grief, to cry out with
lamentations. Thence ANVH, sorrow, affliction; and finally ThAVNH
or ThANVH deep and concentrated grief that one shares or
communicates.

###/keys/AIMThH amath, aimawtha
> Fear, dread, terror, awe, reverence.
According to Rosenroth in [K.D.L.C.K. p.79] This pertains to
Geburah. Recall that PChD Pachad [92] fear, is one of the names
of Geburah. see 216.

###/keys/partzuph [PRTzVP]
> face, person.

###/keys/QLV LISRK kolo leaserekaw
> his voice to instruct thee.
[Deuteronomy 4:36] "out of heaven he hade thee to hear his voice,
that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he sowed thee his
great fire; and thou heard his words out of the midst of the
fire." The fire is Shin (Key 20) and also Teth (Key 8 = Leo = the
Sun). "voice" = Vav.

###/keys/ATh HADMH eth ha-adamah
> the ground. [Genesis 2:5] "(The Lord God
made) every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not
caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till
the ground." "Ground" suggest the physical plane. see 296.

###/keys/KHThAL kahathal
> "God Adorable". 8th Shemhamphorash; angel of 8
of Pentacles (Hod of Assiah). 36-40. Genie: ASICAT. March 27,

According to Godwin, this is the angle of the 2nd quinance (6°-
10°) of Virgo, and angel by night of the 8 of Pentacles.

###/keys/ThANH thanah
> the fig-tree and fruit [Mathers]. This word is used
in [Genesis 3:7] and translated "fig" in the New International
and Authorized Version. "Then the eyes of both of them [Adam and
Eve] were opened, and they realized they were naked, so they
sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings, for themselves."

F.J. Meyers comments: "The word thanah translated 'fig' is just
the word anah [ANH] with the reciprocal or mutual sign Tav
prefixed. Ahinah denotes suffering. In all the Semitic languages
it is an expression of pain, trouble, signing, sobbing, etc. The
prefix Tav gives the word the meaning or 'mutual sorrow',
'sadness shared by others', when the word 'anah' becomes a verb
'ahnoh' it means 'to be plunged into sorrow, and with the prefix
Tav to 'share or communicate some deep sorrow or trouble.'" [The
Unknown God, pp.190-191] see 56, 702, 561.
