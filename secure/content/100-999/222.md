###/keys/AVRIH Uriah
> Light of Wisdom. A compound of AVR, Light, with the divine name IH, Jah, attributed to Chokmah. Uriah is the husband of Bath-Sheba, "Daughter of the Seven." The "seven" are the 7 spirits of God (Elohim) assigned to Binah. Bath-Sheba is the mother of David (love). David's son is Solomon (peaceful or perfected one). he is the type of complete enlightenment, a symbol for the rising sun (Ego in Tiphareth). see 86, 103, 15, 14.

###/keys/ZHIR Zohir
> illuminating. Name of the 2nd Path of Chokmah [variant spelling see 262]. The letters of this word form four of the doctrine of the grade of Magus, as follows:

> - *"Zain, The Lovers. A magus is a man of circumcision. He is free from the influence of the pairs of opposites, because he has sharply distinguished between the positives and negatives. By keen discrimination between the various polarities of differentiation, a magus is able to combine them, neutralize them, and transcend them. His liberation comes through knowledge, not through ignorance...*
> - *"Heh, The Emperor. In consequence of this accurate discrimination, which is largely an exercise in perceptive power, a magus gains the ability to measure al experience correctly. Thus the illumination intelligence is largely mercurial, or discriminative. One must watch before he can reason. A magus takes correct measures because he has watched, and because he has watched, he has learned to see.*
> - *"Yod, The Hermit, illumination, of which the magic of light is at once the consequence and the expression, comes about through subtle chemical and psychic transformations. A magus does nothing of himself. He is an embodiment of the will of God. Thus nothing can withstand him. All things obey him...*
> - *"Resh, The Sun. There is no self-importance in a magus. He has become the 'little child'. Free from care, free from the burden of false responsibilities, free from the limitations of human conventions and opinions. He extracts the nectar of wisdom from the experience of the eternal now. Thus it is written that he has access to the fruition of all desire whatever, at one sweep, being one with all-seeing self.*

> *"It is noteworthy that this word ZHIR is one of the many multiples of the number 37, which we encounter throughout the literature of ageless wisdom. Its numerical value is 222, or 6x37. Since 6 is the number of beauty, and represents also the perfection of the cosmic order, which 37 is the number of a word that means breath or spirit, and is also, in the Pythagorean triangle, the value of the angle which expresses the relation of the ascending hypotenuse to the base, we see that ZHIR, or 6x37 intimates that the illuminating intelligence is the result of the perfect relationship of the personal organism of the magus to the fundamental laws of life. All his thoughts are beautiful, and his words are beautiful and because action and environments are reflections of thought and word, he is continually surrounded by beauty, and that beauty is contagious. This is the reason why magi are always healers and teachers. They heal by their presence. They teach without speech. In their circle of influence ignorance is dispelled, as darkness flies before the sun, and with the cessation of ignorance vanish also the evil consequences thereof."* [Paul Case: True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order (4th), p.453-455]
