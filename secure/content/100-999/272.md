> Fabre D'Olivet comments: *ערב. west-eve... this name famous in all the ancient mythologies, is the Erebus which we have drawn from the Greek ?ε ε ?, and whose origin has so greatly troubled the savants. Its signification is not doubtful. It always recalls to the mind something obscure, distant our of sight. The Hellenists who have rendered it in this passage by εσπε α and the Latins by 'vespere', evening, making visibly weakened the meaning. It signifies the Occident, and all ideas which are related to it, not only in Hebrew, but in Chaldaic, Syriac, Ethopic and in Arabic. The name of the last-mentioned people is derived there from..."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp.35-36]

> Elsewhere he cites [Genesis 8:7](http://biblehub.com//.htm): *"And he [Noah] sent-forth a Raven which went to and fro, but did not return until the waters were dried up from the face of the earth." He renders this verse: "And he sent forth ereb (western darkness) which went to and fro (with periodic movement) until the drying up of the waters upon the earth." And comments: HORB. Ereb... I am well aware that the Hellenist and after them, the author of the Latin vulgate, have seen in ereb, that famed ereb of ancient cosmogonies, only a simple raven: transforming thus a vast and mysterious idea int an idea petty, and ridiculous: but I am also aware that there same Hellenist who worked upon the version which bears the name of the Septuagint, Essences and consequently initiates in the Orallaw, penetrated the hieroglyphic meaning of the sepher deeply enough not to be the dupes of such a metamorphosis. One cannot read them with any kind of attention without discovering their perplexity. Not knowing how to disguise the periodic returns of the alleged bird, and fearing that the truth might shine forth in spite of them, the decided to change completely the original text and be delivered of the ereb which perturbed them, by saying that the raven being sent forth returned no more, [Greek word]. But in this instance, everything betrays their pious fraud. The Samaritan text agrees with the Hebraic text and makes it unassailable; the Samaritan version and the Chaldiac Targum say alike that ereb, given liberty, takes an alternating movement of going forth and coming back; finally Saint Jerome, forced to recognize this truth, can only weaken the force of the phrase by saying, without doubting the first verb and changing their temporal modification of it, 'qui egrediebatur et reurtebatur. It must be remembered that to reveal the depth of this hieroglyphic expression, the ereb was not set at liberty, and did not take this periodic movement until after the release of the nocturnal light referred to in the preceding verse."* [The Hebrew Tongue Restored, pp. 229-230]

> Gaskel suggest, as the Hellenists, that the Raven of Noah returns not again, but is "A symbol of the lower mind, which goes forth to the things of the world." [Dictionary of all Scriptures and Myths, p.613]

> A. Jukes writes: "The dove and the raven are sent forth, figuring (for they are birds of heaven, and the heaven is the understanding) certain powers or emotion of the understanding, both pure and impure. In the action of these is shown the working of the good and evil which to the last remains with us. The raven, finding its food in carrion, figures these inclinations with feed on dead things." [Types of Genesis, p.120]
