## 220 - Two Hundred Twenty
4x5x11. Circumference of a circle having a radius of 70, symbolizing the horizon established by our limits of vision (Ayin). 10x22 = the number of Sephiroth (10) times the number of letters of the Hebrew Alphabet (22).

> 220 is the first of those numbers called 'amiable' or 'friendly' by the Pythagoreans. This word became known to the erudite of Europe who had studied such works as the writings of Nichonachus, Iabblicus and Boetius. Amiable numbers are those in which the aliquot parts or submultiples of the first add to a second number which, in turn, has aliquot parts or submultiples whose sum is the first number. The first pair of amicable numbers is 220 and [284](284). The aliquot parts of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110. The sum of these numbers is 284. The aliquot parts of 284 are 1, 2, 3, 71 and 142. The sum of these is 220. Now in Greek gematria 284 is the number of *agathos,* 'good', of *hagios,* 'sacred, holy,' and of *theos,* 'God'. Really, the three words are simply different ways of saying the same thing. Thus tat to which 220 is amiable, or friendly, is God himself. And since the parts of 284 add up to 220, which the parts of 220 add up to 284, we have here a numerical symbol of just what is implied in the union of the hypoteneuse with the vertical line of teh Pythagorean triangle, and just what is implied by the coalescence of the words 'father and son' in the Hebrew for 'stone' *[True and Invisible, p60]*

### [Tahoor](/keys/THVR) - טהור
> Clean, pure, purified Intelligence of the [9th Path](9). The reproductive functions of the automatic consciousness are not evil potencies. Formed by Teth, the alphabetical symbol of the serpent power or astral Light -- spiritual energy manifested physically as the radiance of stars or suns. Heh, the function of sight, both physical and mental vision. What we see determines the response of automatic consciousness. Vav, hearing, or brain activity which puts one in touch with super-consciousness. Resh, the sun, the forces of automatic consciousness are reflections of solar force -- the vibratory energy of cosmic electricity -- the power of pure spirit made manifest on the physical plane. The adjective tahoor means primarily "clean". It gives the lie to all those false notions which put the stigma of ipurity and uncleanness on those powers of organic life which are truly basic in evolution. See [80](80), 87, 570. *[Gematria PFC]*

### [Car](/keys/KR) - כר
> a male lamb. Initials of the founder of the Rosicrucian Order. Also symbolizing the One Ego, the (CR)istos and for all associated names: The Egyption Khoor (Horus), the Freemasonic KhuRun Abiv (Hiram Abiff), the Hindo KRishna and the Rosicrucian "Father and Brother" C.R. (the founder of the Order). All of these refer to the Holy Guardian Angel, in Tiphareth, the soul of all Humanity. Also battering ram, meadow, pasture *[Gematria PFC]*

> ...The Lamb is one of the Great Gnostic Christian symbols, as well as a favorite symbol of the exoteric church... The son who is one with the father, and therefore mentioned, again and again in the manifestos, as 'our father, brother C.R.'... the distinguising badge of the Masonic fraternity, a symbol of innocence and goodness, is a white lambskin apron... The New Testament [Revelation 21](http://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/21.htm) says definitely that the lamb sits on the throne in the midst of the New Jerusalem, ruling all things from that central position, and illuminating all from the same center... *[True and Invisible, p61]*

### [Bachir](/keys/BChIR) - בחיר
> One of the elect, to select; to choose, chosen one. [Psalm 89:3](http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm). This word is applied throughout the Old Testament to Israel, and transferred by Cnostic Christianity to the spiritual Israel who receive the sacred inheritance, not according to the flesh, but according to something higher. The elect, throughout the New Testament, are the Saints, the sacred ones, who are the few selected from the many who are called. They are characterized by compassion, and they are pure, clean, honest and free from all pollution. Thus their natures are described by the adjective **tahoor**, "clean, pure, elegant." *[True and Invisible, p61]* see 540.

> [Psalm 89:3](http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm) "I have made a covenant with my **chosen one.**" [2 Samuel 21:6](http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm) "Gibeah of Saul--the LORD's **chosen one.**"

### [Masu Ha-Bonim](/keys/MASV.HBVNIM) - מאסו הבונים
> Refused by the builders [Psalm 118:22](http://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm) "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone." One of the most important phrases in occult terminology. In the Rosicrucian allegory, it refers to [brother C.R.](/keys/KR). In the New Testament it is expounded as a reference to Christ. It has also a Masonic meaning. see 103, [53](53), 273.

### [Naphatz](/keys/NPTz) - נפץ
> To break to pieces, to break, shatter; to disperse, scatter. As a noun: [Nephetz](/keys/NPTz) cloudburst, storm, bursting explosion. Compare with [Key 16](16) and its relation to the Mars-force and to Yesod. "Destruction is the foundation (yesod) of existence" [Book of Tokens]. Also: [Nephatz](/keys/NPTz) to be pulverized. Part of the preparation of the alchemical "powder of projection."

### [Roke](/keys/RK) - רך
> Tenderness, delicacy; gentle, bland. The Hebrew equivalent of the initials R.C., said in the Fama to have been adopted by the Rosicrucians as the seal, mark and character of the fraternity. R.C. were the initials of the brother who founded the Rosicrucian order, as well as those of one of the 4 other brethren, who represented the elements required to complete the establishment of the work. Thus brother 'roke' or compassion. *[Gematria PFC]*

> Tenderness must come first and foremost in work of this kind. Sympathy with human suffering, understanding of human problems through ability to put oneself in another's shoes, unselfish desire to lift the heavy burden of ignorance from the minds of the unenlightened -- these are primary requirements *[True and Invisible]* The fifth point of the Rosicrucian agreement in the Fama was "that the word R.C. should be their seal, mark and character". See [2](2), [6](6), [19](19), [84](84), 312.

### [Vardiy](/keys/VRDI) - ורדי
> Rosy. A Rabbinical Hebrew word of particular importance because of its connection to the Rosicrucian fraternity, which was known from its first manifestoes as the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross. See [260](260).

### Novus Ordo Seclorum (Lt 220)

### Christus, Deus et Home (Lt 212)
> Christ, God and Man [Secret Symbols, p36]. A clear indication as to what the Fama means when it speaks of C.R. as the foundation of the order.

    .C  H  R  I  S  T  U  S

This is 212, not 220.

### Ignis Philosophorum (Lt 219)
Fire of the philosophers.

> This is the fire of the sages which they describe in such obscure terms, as to have been the indirect cause of beguiling many innocent persons to their ruin; so even that they have perished in poverty because they know not this fire of the Philosophers. It is the most precious fire that God has created in the earth and has a thousand virtues -- nay, it is so precious that men have averred that the divine power itself works effectually in it. *[Hermetic Museum I, pp. 198-199]*

This is 219, not 220.
