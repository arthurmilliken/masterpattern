### [Sekhel Ne'eman](/keys/ShKL.NAMN) - שכל נאמן
> Faithful Intelligence. [22nd path](22) of [Lamed](/keys/L). Joins the seat of volition with the Central Ego.

All work is attributed to this path, including the Great Work-whose secret is equilibrium. The possessor of this path is mentally and emotionally poised, and he result of his work established balance in his surroundings.

He masters wild beasts in his environment because he has subdued their counter-part-the coiled serpent power-in his own nature. He is an unobstructed channel for the one free will, which established the undeviating Justice of universal law. see [67](67), [74](74), [141](141), [1141](1141).
