And for the chief (things) of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the everlasting hills. {[16](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-16.htm)} And for the precious things of the earth and its fulness and for the goodwill of Him that dwells in the bush; let [blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of head of him that was separate [and prince] among his brothers. {[17](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm)} Like a firstling young bull his majesty is, and his horns like the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall push the peoples, all of them, to the ends of the earth; and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh."*
