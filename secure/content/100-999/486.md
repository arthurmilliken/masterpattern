Hence it is a synonym for the narrow way, the way of the mystics: or for the few who in their evolution, have passed the narrow gate. The khristos, the anointed in godhood, is its goal. it may be remembered that Demeter, when seeing the Kore [virgin], sat on a 'reverend rock' (agelastos petra)."* [Letters from Paulos, pp.261-262] see [2521](2521), [2881](2881), [2886](2886), [1494](1494).
