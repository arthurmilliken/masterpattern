The tabernacle was a pavilion or booth, and the festival was one of thanksgiving for the harvest. This is a feminine word, corresponding to the pillar of Boaz. Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry says: "Master: where were they cast? Senior warden: on the banks of the river Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zaradath, were King Solomon order these, and all other holy vessels to be cast." see 79, 699.

### [petra]
> rock. [beginning of text missing] ...drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank [water] from a spiritual rock which followed them; (but the rock was the anointed)." see 1262, 1270, 53, 1480, 1554, 755.

> Omikron says that πετ α, as a symbol "is used in an antiphrastic sense which, relying on an alleged composition of the word, suggests a rapid rising to a great height. Hence it is a synonym for the narrow way, the way of the mystics: or for the few who in their evolution, have passed the narrow gate. The khristos, the anointed in godhood, is its goal. it may be remembered that Demeter, when seeing the Kore [virgin], sat on a 'reverend rock' (agelastos petra). [Letters from Paulos, pp.261-262] see 2521, 2881, 2886, 1494.
