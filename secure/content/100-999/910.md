### [Astarte](/greek?word=astart+h) (Gr) - ασταρτη
> *Astarte or [Ashtoreth](/keys/OShThRTh) (Greek: Ἀστάρτη, Astártē) is the Hellenized form of the Middle Eastern goddess Ishtar, worshipped from the Bronze Age through classical antiquity. The name is particularly associated with her worship in the ancient Levant among the Canaanites and Phoenicians. She was also celebrated in Egypt following the importation of Levantine cults there. The name Astarte is sometimes also applied to her cults in Mesopotamian cultures like Assyria and Babylonia.* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astarte).
