### [katzel yawmenu Al ha-eretz](/keys/KTzL.IMINV.OL-HARTz) - כצל ימינו על־הארץ
> *He hath made the earth by his powers.* [1 Chron. 29:15](http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-15.htm). Translated in American Version as *"For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding."* Appropriate enough if we consider that the order, as raised to a cube by the second four brethren form the square suggested by the first four, is a symbol which from the days of Pythagoras has been associate with earth. [PFC, True and Invisible, Page 161].

> Note: these words appear in [Jeremiah 10:12](http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-12.htm), [51:15](http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-15.htm) as עשה ארץ בכחו, [Oseh eretz bekcho](/keys/OShH.ARTz.BKChV) and their numeration is [702](702). Paul Case notes: *"In the original הארץ is written with a large Aleph, so that the phrase may also be reckoned as [1651](1651) = [127](127)x[13](13), which however, the Massoretic text use does not give the large Aleph."*

### [rebbothim](/keys/RBThIM) - רבתים

### [CRC.GV.IA.IO.GG.PD.RC.B](/keys/KRK.GV.IA.IO.GG.PD.RK.B) - כרך גו יא יע גג פד רך ב
> *"If the [Rosicrucian] Founder's initials are taken as C.R.C., then the total value of the initials of the eight original Brethren is 652, which is significant to a Christian Qabalist because it is twice [326](326), and 326 is the value of the Christian Qabalistic spelling of [Yeheshua](/keys/IHShVH), or Jesus: יהשוה. This is a spelling found in innumerable Qabalistic writings contemporary with the FAMA, or published within the next 50 years. It has, of course a direct bearing on the Rosicrucian motto: [Jesus Mihi Omnia](/latin?word=jesus+mihi+omnia)..."* [True and Invisible (WeiserBooks) p. 96]. see [312](312), [8](8), [150](150) Latin; [632](632), [702](702), [291](291).
