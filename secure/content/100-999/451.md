### [tehom](/keys/ThHVM) - תהום
> the abyss of the waters, great deep [Genesis 1:2](http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm). By this Gematria the "great deep," or dark abyss of primal water, is Qabalistically identified with the idea of the universal essence of the human race. Darkness and evil provide the raw material which is then formed into light, and then made into good. It is also the which precedes the manifestation of individualized man, yet it is also one with man's essential nature. see eth ha-adam, [430](430), [691](691), [1011](1011), [681](681); [1273](1273) (Greek).
